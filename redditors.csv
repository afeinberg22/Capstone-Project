I’m not a medical professional and I may be very wrong but I’m just gonna call this a panic attack.

This was the second time it’s ever happened to me throughout my life. Both have happened in my sleep and made me wake up shaking and in absolute fear.

I was supposed to visit a somewhat nearby somewhat faraway city today, and I was very excited to go while packing my bags last night. I wanted to visit museums, restaurants, and possibly catch up with someone whom I recently befriended. I was especially excited about the last part because I’m not the type to make new friends easily, and haven’t had any romantic interest in anyone for almost a decade, and this new friend handily broke through both for me.

However, this panic attack just ruined everything for me. I woke up hours before my departure, soaked in cold sweat, dreading my decision to go on this trip, dreading talking to this friend again in fears of screwing something up and driving them away, just absolutely doubting my upcoming career switch, everything. 

I recognized that I was probably being irrational, and told myself that I’m not having a panic attack because I’m afraid of these things but rather that the panic attack is putting me in a state to be afraid of everything and these are the things on my mind right now. Even knowing this, I still can’t shake... what I can only describe as a feeling of dread.

I’ve never really felt any attachment to life. I don’t put much value on my life because I enjoy nothing and have no friends. People from both online and real life tell me that I need to find something that I’m passionate about, but I can’t really internalize that because that first assumes that I must live. The problem is that I personally don’t think there’s any inherent value to life and anyone who wants to end it should be able to do so without life being a duty. If somebody wants to live because of whatever reason, fine, do that. I personally don’t want to live for the sake of living, which gives me no motivation to search for a cause to keep me going, and simply want all of this to end.

My panic attack seems to have amplified some of my suicidal thoughts by putting me in a very odd state for the whole day. I’d start getting nervous again when trying to do anything as significant as picking up my phone or walking to a different room in the house. This is probably just physical, and I can handle that by just taking things easy. Something that really bothers me is the possibility that panic attacks may become a recurring event in my life, however few years may be left of it. What if this stops me from being any use for the world? What if this drives the few people I may become close to in my life? What if whomever I fall in love with is disgusted by my depression and panic attacks? What if this feeling of dread is something that I have to constantly deal with? 

My life will be going through some big changes in the next few months/years, and I’m just so afraid that I’ll be utterly destroyed during the process, both by what I’ll be going through and these panic attacks, feeding each other in a vicious cycle.

Maybe that’s a good thing though, if it gives me the gentle push to overcome the fear of the unknown and finally end everything. Maybe that’s all I want and all I need, to finally die and free myself from this rat race. Free from insecurity about my abilities. Free from my insecurity about human relationships.

I thought I was gone for longer and was pretty proud of myself at times that I didn't feel the need to come here and vent. Guess it wasn't that long of a time after all and there's not much to be proud about anyway. This is going to be a rant, by the way, so don't expect much structure or logic. I don't expect people to read this post that closely or try to actually understand anyway.

Whatever. I just wanted to talk about how fucking tired I am of life. I just got into really good grad schools, but not for something that I'm really interested in or good at. This terrifies me because I'll be competing against people some of whom are going to be some of the brightest minds in the country fueled by motivation. The only reason I decided to go this route is that it'll help me make good money, which is at least better than just languishing in poverty.

I don't have friends. Don't need them, don't want them. Nobody to care about, live up to, or to be disappointed by. My family's literally the only reason I haven't killed myself. That's all changing because I'm just so fucking tired of my family too now.

I'm the youngest of my family. The ramblings in the post may not be good evidence but I'm probably the most intelligent out of my family. This leads to me noticing a lot of things that my family should be doing differently to be more efficient. You know, ""make a webpage for the family business and prepare for the online commerce era,"" or ""get out of this town because the economy here is going to die in 10 years."" I've given them these kinds of predictions/suggestions a good 5-10 years ahead of them actually happening, yet they discount everything I say because I'm the youngest in my family. Even after seeing everything actually unfolding the way I told them they would, they still completely ignore what I say. When confronted about how they never take my words seriously, they say they do take me seriously, but we all know they don't. 

Back in my teenage years, they were so unreasonably confident in their ignorance that they kept me from visiting a dermatologist for severe cystic acne, which I knew was different from anything I've ever had, but they thought they knew everything and I ended up having severe scars all over my face. This had profound impact on my self esteem and they're still so nonchalant about this.

Really, I just want to die. I don't want to go to school to study something I don't want to, just to work in a field that I don't care about, to toil away just to pay for rent and paltry entertainment that really amounts to nothing.

I’m feeling pretty fucking hopeless about my future after having tried and failed for so many years. There’s really no more ways to improve my chances for anything because I’ve tried everything I realistically can and it still wasn’t enough.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for almost a decade and couldn’t talk to anyone about it because one wrong move and it will literally get me locked up somewhere and leave a permanent record to ensure that my already lost cause has no chance of redemption. Not to mention the amount of time and money that will be wasted.

I also don’t think that there is a universal, logical argument to support an inherent value to life, or why one should live. Yes, people can “make the best of the present,” but why should one choose that over just quitting life? We all know that “it gets better, you have so much to live for, and think of the pain you’ll cause to others” is also just emotional bullshit that holds no real weight to people who don’t care about emotional talks and want logical reasons to keep on living. Maybe it works for people who are having an isolated, spontaneous desire to die, but not for someone like myself, who’s been thinking about suicide for almost a decade and definitely wanting to die for the last 5 years.

The thing is, I would love to talk to a professional just to see how different they would be compared to shitty internet lists with “people are having sex right now and all you can think of is suicide? Come on!” as one of their 50 reasons against suicide. Surely they’ve dealt with people who want an objective reason to not kill oneself; have they given any thought into this argument? But guess what, they’re expensive and they can call 911 against me any time they feel like I’m going to do something whether that’s true or not. There won’t be any candid conversation with that kind of pressure, and there won’t be real help (if it even exists) without a real conversation.

I think the ability to call 911 for a forced admission pretty much kills all chances for meaningful help for people like me.

A disclaimer: I'm not trying to promote or even advocate suicide. Disclaimer 2: This is probably not going to make any sense because I'm just writing as I think.

I'm depressed. Everything in my life is falling apart. Actually, it feels more like I'm stuck and won't get anywhere. I don't want to get anywhere anymore at this point though. My only reason for not killing myself used to be that I couldn't think of a quick, painless way that would leave behind a clean and peaceful body. I'm caring less and less about that now though.

Now, in regards to my title. What's the point of stopping someone from suicide? That person wants release from whatever pain they're going through, and death will give that release to them. Whatever ""happiness that they'll find in the future"" is literally irrelevant. It's not ""not good,"" it's not ""bad,"" it's literally irrelevant because the person won't feel anything at that point. ""Think of what you might accomplish"" is just guilt-tripping and even potentially setting up for a future suicidal intent if the person feels they didn't amount to anything after all.

Personally, I don't think there's any good reason to stop suicide that's actually in the suicidal person's best interest. The person just wants relief. Saying things like ""think of what you might accomplish"" or ""what about your loved ones"" is basically just holding them as hostages.

The worst part is that I'm unable to off myself because of those reasons; I don't want to make my ""loved ones"" feel bad. This really sucks.

I've posted several times and have had some very supportive women help me to remain calm and I'm at that point again where I am about to give up.
As of today I have officially been on my period for 95 days straight....non stop... It has been heavy all but 9 days. When I say heavy, I mean I have went through super plus hospital grade pads in less than two hours they will be soaked and falling apart.
I have been to five doctors this year and to sum them up...
1. Doctor one did tests and put me on birth control (depo shots) which I was highly allergic to (I fainted constantly and had fell out once and had to drag myself to a phone to call for help). When I stopped the medicine he said there is nothing they can do. They wanted to see if I have endometriosis but can't do the surgery to find out due to other health conditions.
2. Doctor two on the FIRST DAY walked into the room, sat down, and undiagnosed me from having PCOS (a diagnosis I've had for several years). Her reasoning? I had no acne or facial hair so I didn't have PCOS. Even after I explained to her I had a clear face week and I shave my face daily. She also did no examination at all. She just sat down and said I didn't have it.
3. Doctor three refused to even see me after waiting in her office for 4 hours.... she had seen 7 walk in patients in that time... I had an appointment. 
4. Doctor four agreed I needed help and said he would talk to a general surgeon about checking me for endometriosis. I waited 3 months and he saw the surgeon once a week and never mentioned me despite him saying to me and putting in his notes that I was a priority and would be talked about the very next meeting he had with said surgeon. 
5. Doctor five is by far the worst..... My first initial meeting with him went ok despite a severe attitude he had when I required my mother to be present (I have PTSD and get uncomfortable around males I don't know). It went normal. He did an initial exam and told me to come back next month when he could gather all my records from previous gynos and get me on medicine. He did start me on a hormone that day too. The next visit he stopped the hormone and put me on birth control pills despite me being very wary of them. The third visit I went back because I had allergic reactions to the pills. The doctor came in and said word for word, ""I've done everything I can with you and I have no idea what is wrong or how to help you. You need to find another physician."" To which my husband asked, ""Is it normal for her to bleed 80 days at one time?"" To which the doctor, again word for word said, ""Oh yes. For people her age around 18 to 25 it's very normal."" The doctor then got upset and tried to refuse giving me my medical records from his care.
Now, I am out of options. I've been on shots, 13 different pills, and the patch, all I was SEVERLY allergic to. Insurance will not cover any other form of birth control and I do not have the money to pay out of pocket for it. Insurance will not cover a hysterectomy which is about 8000 or more dollars which I also cannot afford. I'm on day 95 and losing my fucking sanity (sorry for the lanuage).

Anyways, recently we were discussing things we enjoy and don't enjoy in our bdsm lifestyle. For reference there are about 25 people in the group (maube less, but definitely no more than 25). In the group I (age 20) am the youngest. 

One of the things mentioned was humiliation and  degradation, specifically name calling, but general aspects of humiliation and degradation. Everyone gave their opinion on the matter. Then I mentioned it was not something I enjoyed and that it really had a negative impact on me, everyone in the group (I'm not exaggerating, literally everyone) jumped onto me saying I wasn't a true submissive and that I was just in it for the sexual aspect. They told me if I didn't enjoy it I wasn't a submissive, never would be, and I was a poser. I never got to argue because the admin of the group removed me.

Honestly this really hurts. I got into BDSM when I was underage which is why I talk so much about minors in the community. I know it was wrong of me to get into it so early, but I have had a lot of experience, both good and bad during my discovery of my submission. It had taken a lot of growing, maturing, and learning to get where I am now (which is happily married in a 24/7 bdsm relationship with my husband). However, their comments have made me so upset.

I've been in a DDLG relationship for quite some time now (2+ years) and my Daddy (also my husband) introduced me to it kinda. I knew about ddlg but didn't know it was something I would like. Anyways I'd been submissive (M/s type relationships) before I met him so when I found ddlg with him it clicked that this is what I needed. It helped with stress, anxiety, my ptsd, and so much more. This was all within our first 6 months together. We got together in January of 2016.

Fast forward to August 2016. We both went through something and while he was affected, I got the majority of the pain from it (willing to discuss if needed). Because of that, I couldn't be little at all. I was not little for several months until February of 2017. I told him at the beginning of February I wanted a whole day to be little, but didn't tell him why. He let me have my little dat and it was amazing. To this day it is still one of my favorite days ever. Later that night when I was out of littlespace and being big/adult, I told him why I wanted the little day. I wanted it because I wanted to give up DDLG and my littleside due to lack of being little causing my mental illnesses to get worse, causing lack of enthusiasm in anything, and stuff like that. He told me not to give it up, so after a long discussion I didn't. 

Now fast forward to October of 2017. I had been little a total of five or six hours... all by myself. No Daddy. Just me. I had told him several times I needed to be little and he finally set up a littles playdate for me and 2 little friends. We went and the first day was fun. I was little all day until that night we all stopped being little and went to a club where stuff happened and triggered my ptsd so it was impossible for me to be little for the rest of the night until the middle of the next day. The little friends (I will call C and S) and daddy and I all went to a kids muesem and I finally slipped back into littlespace. C's mom (keep in mind all C, S, and I are all early 20s in age) anyways Cs mom caused problems with C, who is a 24/7 little, and she ended up getting my Daddy to comfort her. No big deal there. Well, then I'd had enough of it. Her mom was ruining my littlespace that I almost never got, and I wanted to be little and was slowly slipping out of it. So I'll admit, for the rest of our trip, I was a brat. A full blown annoying brat. I was hurt, and upset, and just wanted to go home. So when we got home I got a punishment (5 belt licks) for being a brat. I later explained to him why I was a brat, and he still acts like he doesn't care about it. 

Now, from that day I slipped out of littlespace at the Museum to this day (March 2018) I still have not been little. I've tried and I cant. Ive told Daddy I need to be little and he finally cracked last month and offered for me to be little only to ruin it by making me adult less than 30 minutes later.

It's getting to the point that I hatw being little. I hate DDLG. And it isnt fair to my little friends because anytime they post something little related or cute, I hate it. It makes me hate them. Im turning into a hateful person and I dont want to but I dont know what else to do.

I've had irregular periods since I was 14 due to several different medical issues. There is nothing they can do to fix it. Due to this issue my periods last anywhere from 28 days to 64 days long, non stop, 64 being the longest. 

Usually my symptoms are normal: Cramps, headaches, and bloating. But as I've gotten older (I turned 20 two months ago) my symptoms have changed. 

My mild cramps are now so painful I can not move. They also come out of nowhere and can make me drop to my knees in pain.

My headaches have changed to migraines and have even gotten so bad I've begged my husband to kill me.

It's also impacting my sleep. I can not sleep at night due to the pain and the only reason I sleep during the day is because exhaustion kicks in and I pass out.

I can't eat, drink, or take medicine without nausea, and 9 out of 10 times I vomit **everything**. 

I also have heartburn so bad it makes it hard to breathe and nothing I take helps. (I've even been prescribed medicine for this.)

Not to mention because my periods last so long I am incredibly sore down there. I can switch things up but I am still sore constantly. Tampons and the cup make me sore inside, and pads make me have almost a diaper rash and incredibly sore outside. I've taken up free bleeding which I hate because I have a germ and OCD problem with body cleanliness and I feel nasty bleeding on myself.

It wasn't 'till you talked to me the other night and for some reason all the hate dissapeared. We started to talk, because you wanted to fix everything with me for some reason, because we had a lot in common.

People around us thought that we were crazy for being together and i understand why, but we didn't care.

Soon something started to happen, we had that bond, we needed each other to have fun. And i think that's where we started to feel it. The feeling of love, that kind of feeling that you get when you are with someone you love. But both of us knew that it couldn't happen because you already had someone in your life.

But that didn't stop you from telling that you really like me too but you had someone. And i respect it.

Now we are that kind of lovely friends and i'm okay with that, but i can't shake this feeling of guilty from me. This ain't right and you know it too, but i think that we can't stop it because we are too weak to separate..

We both have our set of mental health problems - she has generalized anxiety and occasional bouts of depression, and I have C-PTSD and ongoing major depressive disorder. I've been struggling with thoughts of suicide almost daily for over a year now, so this is already a sensitive and ""triggering"" subject for me.

In my opinion, I've often been there for her more than she's been there for me (partially because she's better about reaching out for help - when I get depressed, I withdraw from the world and don't talk to anyone for weeks or months at a time).

So, lately my friend has been going through a particularly hard time since she's been working tirelessly for 5 years to transfer to a competitive university, and she's had two episodes of having a meltdown in response to challenges at school, and she's called me in hysterics saying she wants to kill herself on both occasions. This happened last night, and I was in the middle of work with a deadline, but I was very concerned about her. Once again I dropped what I was doing to go check on her. I made her some tea and empathized with how she was feeling, told her I cared about her, encouraged her to schedule an appointment with her therapist (she did do that), and told her I hope she would call me to take her to the ER or take herself to the ER if she was really thinking about hurting herself. This conversation took up 4 hours of my day, and when I got in my car at 11 PM to drive home, I started crying because this is stressful for me, and I know I'm not a therapist and I need to put my own mental health first.

On the one hand, I'm scared for her, but on the other hand I'm frustrated because she doesn't seem to care or realize how talking in detail about her suicide plans and how ""nobody cares"" about her (she even repeatedly said I would ""get over"" her dying in 1 year, and I told her that wasn't true, but she wouldn't hear it). I understand how depression can make you believe nobody cares about you, and it can make you feel very detached, so cognitively I can understand how she doesn't think about how she's affecting me and my mental health while she's in crisis. At the same time, I'm feeling self-protective because I need to take care of my mental health, and I often seem to be someone that other people come to for suicidal feelings (my friend, my sister, and my dad have all done similar things to me).

I feel stuck because when I try to encourage her to go to the ER or see her therapist, she says there's no point and nobody can help her. I tried asking for her family's phone numbers so I could contact them if I'm concerned she's in crisis, and she resisted because she doesn't want to be 51/50'd. She doesn't have much family support, and right now she's living alone, and I seem to be the only person she is willing to talk to. She went to therapy today, and as soon as she stepped out of the appointment, she told me she'd finally made a plan and figured out how to kill herself.

I know that I'm not responsible for anyone else's emotions, but I'm torn because I'm worried about her and care for her, but I also don't want to sacrifice myself to try and keep her safe. My intuition tells me she has the impulsivity required to actually kill herself, but she doesn't seem to have the knowledge or means to do so effectively.

Lastly, it's really hard to draw a boundary with this friend because, due to my own depression, she is literally the only friend I have right now. Making things even harder, I had to draw a boundary with my sister regarding her calling me during her suicidal breakdowns, and she took it so badly that she hasn't spoken to me in four years, and that experience was a difficult one that I'm not eager to repeat with my friend.

**TLDR**: Friend is suicidal, it's wearing me out, but she's alone and doesn't have support so I'm worried. I've tried telling her to seek professional help but she's mostly resistant. I have mental health challenges of my own. I don't know what to do and I feel helpless.

Hello everyone, I'm new to NVC so I'm still trying to understand its applications. I have a particular question that I'm hoping someone could clarify for me. Based on my understanding, it seems that NVC emphasizes needs-based dialogue which avoids blaming others for our pain, and instead encourages us to make observations--not diagnoses--and relate that to an unmet need. In other words, one wouldn't say ""you hurt my feelings"" or ""you hurt me.""

My question is this: is a child held to the same standards? If a child is emotionally abused by a caregiver, is it not true for the child to think and feel as though the caregiver did directly hurt them? Without higher cognitive functions and with limited communication skills, coupled with the vulnerability of this situation, is it still not appropriate for a child to ""label"" the caregiver as ""abusive"" or some other such term?

As someone with complex PTSD, I find myself drawn to NVC because it helps me better relate to my emotions and develop the skills to convey my needs to others. However, I find myself unsure about how to process past and ongoing emotional abuse from my caregiver. (The immediate issue is less about forgiveness, and more about building a mental framework to understand how a traumatized child could do anything else but label the abuser, and how to recover and grow from that experience.)

I hope I've explained my confusion well enough so that someone with a greater knowledge of NVC can clarify this.

Basically, I'm seeing my mom treat her boyfriend/my boss with all the qualities I never had in sufficient amounts from her: empathy, consideration, respect, and interest. For instance, she spends almost all of her time with him, yet she's always had a set of ""rules"" for how much I can talk to her (she will literally tell me I've talked enough and that it's time to leave her alone, or when I was a kid she would tell me not to talk to her immediately after she got home from work, etc.). Another example: her boyfriend got sick and she went to his house to bring him food and spend the day with him, and yet I recall numerous occasions growing up (and in more recent years) when my mom would scowl when I was sick and asked her to get me some water or soup from the kitchen.

It really hurts to see my mom interested in someone's life and be there for them, especially considering how often she refused to do these things for me. It seems to reinforce my belief that something's wrong with me, and that's why my mom was emotionally abusive toward me growing up. Rationally I know that's probably not true, and there's probably a chance that her kindness will wear off toward him eventually, but she seems really happy and calm when she talks about him. She gets this adoring look on her face that pains me because she rarely shows real affection toward me, and doesn't even like sitting too close to me, or me putting my arm around her, or any of that.

Could someone here please offer me some insight and/or support? This is really hurting me right now and I don't know what to make of it.

Hi everyone, I'm trying to plan a two-week trip for this summer, probably in late May or early June, and am hoping to get your feedback on which of these regions I should visit: Georgia and Armenia, or Kazakhstan. Which country will have better weather? Will the hills and mountains still be green? Which country is easier to get around in? Which is cheaper? More fun? Better food?

I think I'd be okay renting a car, but I hear that Kazakhstan has problems with corrupt police officers. I'm a solo 26-year-old female and don't want to run into too much trouble, but I've traveled alone many times before.

I'm mostly looking to see the countryside, relax a bit (probably rent an apartment or something), and explore some unique small towns and cities. Not really interested in night life or any of that.

Now I got a part time one, in a dog shelter which dogs and cats and animals make me really happy and it somehow gives me a feeling of safety. But they won’t let me hang out with the dogs or do anything dog related. I have a lot of experience in the rescue world. I have to drive two hours round trip to get there and get paid shit and I accepted because I was supposed to be doing animal care, but instead they have me doing paperwork, filing and stupid things like that.

I have a 16 month old westiepoo. I adopted him about six months ago after losing my hospice gal that was about 17, and he is the light of my life. He is the sweetest, smartest dog I have know. He is 15 pounds, but when I say he has the energy of a German shepherd I wish I was exaggerating. We also have a cat, and the amount of times he has tried to get the cat are just too many to count by now.

He has always been a reactive dog, and I have worked with a trainer pretty much since week 1. He is smart, he picks up commands like no other dog. But he also is a little bit of a selective listener... I think he just gets to a stage of hyper-focus and when he gets there, it's hard to bring him down. For the past three months the situation just escalated with the cat and he has actually hurt the cat a couple times. I take all the precautions, I keep them separate, I never leave the dog unattended. He is crate trained... Everything. When the situation started escalating, we added a behaviorist that also has been working with us and the trainer, and some things did help. 

He goes to doggy daycare while I am at work so he can get all the exercise he needs. 

About a month ago, my husband sort of hit a wall, and started talking about rehoming. It broke me, and it broke my heart so hard, I can't even explain how much it hurts. But at this point, we have a trainer, a behaviorist, a veterinarian behaviorist... he has had tests, I am on his training pretty much every minute I can when we are together. He has to work for his food, work for his toys, he eats from puzzles, we go to the park on the weekends, we take REALLY long walks, always to try and keep him tired and in check. It's become exhausting. And it's become so expensive, I can't even think of all the debt I am in and my husband doesn't even know of, because I am afraid of telling him. So many times, the situation has put my marriage at risk, because husband is stressed, and worried about the cat and about me. I have health issues, and already have a lot of trouble sleeping, and still I have been waking up every day at 5:30 and going to sleep past 11 to keep up with his training. 

I am at a point now, that I really don't know if I am the family for him. It feels like he needs to be with people that are with him more than I can be, and people who possibly have another dog (since he does very well when he has a dog friend) but don't have a cat. My money is gone, and my health is going next. It kills me to think of losing my baby, but how much help can I be once my health escalates and I am stuck in bed or the hospital for weeks? 

A few people have been very understanding. Other people just keep implying I am not trying hard enough, and I tend to listen to those more than the others. I keep feeling like I am the worst dog mom out there, like I will never deserve another dog in my life, and how much I am letting my sweet baby down. 

We are meeting a couple on Sunday, and I tried so much to not like them... but I talked to them on the phone yesterday, and they seem so good! They have another dog a tad bit bigger than my baby, they work from home, they have a fenced yard, their lives pretty much revolve around their dog. They have training experience, they have had lots of dogs before, and they said they will do whatever it takes to make me feel better if they do choose to adopt him. 

But I hate myself for having to do it, and the more I hear people imply that there is more to try, and that I have to keep trying and all that, the more it kills me. I read a lot of happy rehoming stories, but I guess I am posting here in hopes of getting a little bit of support, and maybe hearing that I am not that terrible of a person, because it has been really hard to shove that in my mind. 

Please don't shame me, don't be mean... I really just need a little support.

And there are lots of factors that could or couldn't be the problem, so this might a very long post.

I called our vet, but while I wait for them to call me back, I needed to try something else, and try to get some peace of mind. We also do work with a trainer, and she is very helpful. But when he gets 

I have a 15 month old mutt (we thought of many different mixes, but don't know for sure - westiepoo, maltipoo, bichon maltese, havanese something...). He is about 15 pounds. Sweet as can be with me! He is very playful and has a lot of energy, which I manage by taking him to doggy daycare everyday while I am at work, I take him to the park every weekend (both Saturday and Sunday), and I want to start training for a 5k with him, but he is not there yet.

We adopted him on April 12th. From the beginning, he was very interested in our cat, but ended up relaxing after a few weeks. I know he just wants to play... his tail is always wagging and he has his play posture when he messes with him... But when the cat doesn't respond (every single time), he get angry... I take him away, I correct him (by saying no and pulling him away), I try to keep him as distracted as I can. I have food puzzles, I hide high value treats around, so he goes looking for them instead of focusing on the cat. It works a lot of times, but sometimes he just won't let go. On Friday, he lashed out and tried to actually bite the cat, and he did not look playful at that time. And that was very scary to me, because my husband is starting to get more and more worried and mentioned he might not be the right dog for our household. I do not want to get to that point at all! I love this dog too much.

He also has serious separation anxiety. I have been trying to crate train him since we got him, and he goes crazy if he is in there for more than 10-20 minutes. We started very low and built up to this point, but I haven't been able to go any higher. When we leave him home alone, he just can't relax. And I have tried the same way as I have tried with the crate training. Building up the time, but it got to a point that I just can't go any higher.

Yesterday, we tried leaving him alone again for a few minutes. We basically dog proofed the bedroom, put a bunch of toys, chew treats there... and he seemed to have done ok for a few minutes, but then later I found he had peed on the bed. He had been walked for 40 minutes before we tried, he did all his business, and still he peed on the bed. Later, when we opened everything and let him go around as usual, he went and also peed on the couch. He had peed once in the couch in the past, but yesterday was just too much with doing it on both places. 

I don't know if this is related at all, but this morning after we woke up, he threw up some bile. 

I am afraid for his health. He is potty trained, and the peeing on furniture just doesn't seem normal to me. Adding the throw up this morning, I am pretty close to freaking out. The behavior with the cat is also very scary to me. Again, a lot of times, he listens to commands, and is amazing at his training. But once the cat (or sometimes another dog, or some people) get in the equation, it's like his hearing is gone, his awareness of me is gone... He also won't listen to commands from my husband ever and at all, and he is involved in all training sessions. He won't even let him put his harness on without some struggle. 

Any and every input is more than welcome... and even some moral support.

I have read around here but I feel like I have such a specific issue, so I am starting a new thread. 
Three weeks ago, I rescued a 15 year old lady dog. She is believed to be a corgi mix. We have been working on potty training, as she has had a few accidents inside the house. She has been doing great! I have put her on a schedule, and we go out every four hours for potty breaks. Because she is so old, those walks around the block are enough exercise for her. 
Her accidents inside the apartment have gone down drastically, which is great. 
The thing is, we live in an apartment complex. When we go out, sometimes (maybe half the time, maybe a bit more), she will start peeing in the hallway. I have tried taking her down all the way and only leashing her when we are at the front door of the building, right before going on the sidewalk, I have tried leashing her inside the apartment... but the only way to prevent her from peeing in the hallway is by carrying her... but I want her to learn NOT to pee in the hallway. 
I have been rewarding her for peeing outside, and rewarding her every time she goes through the hallway without peeing. But that doesn't seem to be enough.
I also try stopping her in the middle of the peeing when she starts going... as soon as she starts, I will clap or say no or pull her... but that doesn't do much... she takes a while to even stop. 
Any tips or tricks? 
Thanks. 

Edit: I just noticed that today, we went out and I stopped her in the middle of hallway pee. She then didn't pee outside either. I am afraid I am some how ""breaking"" her and will make her think peeing is not ok.

It's fixed and it works! Thanks to /u/Rasalas8910!!

Hi all, I am sorry if this is a stupid or a not-allowed post. I read more than I ever post here, so, technically a newbie. 

Anyway, 

I was waiting for the new Pixel to be released before upgrading my current phone, but ended up having to get a new phone just now (couple months before the freaking release). So I tried getting something used, and went for a Nexus 5X. I bought it online and it turns out the previous owner has been a Google Dev for a while and, a little bit too late, I realized that the phone I bought from him has a tweaked version of the beta O.... (not cool!). I mean, the phone works, but not 100%, like some apps will crash and all. 

Besides that, he sold me the phone as being a 32 GB and when I look at the storage, I am pretty sure it's a 16 (it says there are X GB free out of 15Gb) Can it be because of the beta version and all the debugging apps? Or was I actually scammed? 

Is it worth rolling back to Android N? 
I have tried, but it has been a hassle so far... 

Any insight is welcome. 
And please, don't mock me, as I have been mocking myself enough for it already.

I was afraid of him overreacting and sending me to the hospital or something, which I can't afford.

Is there anything I can do to speed this up and talk to a therapist or psychologist sooner than later?

Thanksgiving and Christmas are the biggest bunch of bullshit. I fight all year long to keep my shit together and not get too down. I finally feel a little better when Fall gets here with the nice weather and all, just to relapse into the deepest pit of depression all year around the holidays.

It's too cold and usually wet to enjoy a long walk to clear my head, so i'm stuck indoors most of the time. My truck doesn't like to run right in the cold. Work sucks as I work in a factory with no heat and have to bust ass because we're usually behind in production and trying to hurry and catch up before the year ends. I get fatter due to stress eating and the lack of getting out.

I don't like my friends and hate most of my family. I'm pretty anti-social in general, or I just haven't met my type of person I guess, I dunno. So of course I hate the fake phone calls from ""friends"" and ""family"" I don't speak to all year. And my stupid bigoted redneck POS dad ""checking in on me"" and asking what to get me for christmas and when we're gonna meet up with my sister and his white trash friends. I tell him the same thing every year: don't get me anything and I don't want to be around your friends.

I want to tell everyone to just leave me the fuck alone.

And yet I still end up over there and draining my bank account to buy everyone gifts and faking smiles, because I'm afraid of pushing the few people I have away and being completely alone.

Fuck it all, I'm thinking about just telling everyone the truth this year. I don't like you, I'm not ""doing"" holidays next year, which means I'm not buying you shit, Thanksgiving and Christmas are lies that only the dumbest and most shallow of people fall for, and I'm not gonna act happy and like I give a shit about family and Jesus for 2 months just because the calendar and people expect me to.

But lately, I've found that I don't desire being around other people at all, not even my gf. My most comfortable days are when I'm off work and she's at work, and I have the house to myself. I'll get lost in a video game or something and ignore my phone and the outside world.

I'm struggling the entire time to stay cool and suppress my nerves and negative thoughts.

I was talking to a friend a few days ago, and he was telling me about how I should meet so and so and how ""fun"" he and his crew are to be around.

I'm 25, live in a small town in Georgia, and have been contemplating suicide more days than not since 12 years old. 2 unsuccessful attempts. I don't have much family, nothing to do with relatives on either side (mom was adopted and dad's side live on the other end of the US and are part of an extreme cult-like religion). My dad's always been an absent, strung out, drunk, stupid, ignorant and uneducated redneck pussy. I love my mom and younger sister, but my mom passed away last year after fighting crippling illnesses and doctor fuck-ups for over 13 years. So I pretty much grew up without a mom, too. I've never had many friends or fit in around here at all, school or otherwise (I don't like religion or sports other than MMA). I tend to dislike or hate most people anyway. I did manage to find a good girl to be with, though, and we've been together over 2 years, living together for about 1 year. Her and my sister are the only reasons now I don't just stick my .45 in my mouth and pull the trigger.

I've read all the self-help shit, tried it all, read posts here there everywhere, tried talking to people/loved ones (they didn't understand/didn't know what to say/judged me). I've tried drugs, got off those because they didn't help. Started drinking heavily after mom died. That was the lowest, darkest point of my life so far but I'm sober now. I've heard it all... 

""Why are YOU depressed? You have nothing to be depressed about!""
""I'm so sorry, I wish there was something I could do for you...""
""Sometimes you just gotta be a man and suck it up! Things will get better when you make them better!""
""Write stuff down, make a bucket list and just start checking that shit off.""

I've really, honestly fought like hell to beat this shit. I feel like I've done almost everything I can to get things right with what I can control, and from the outside looking in you'd say I have a pretty good life. I'm in a good relationship, have a good (enough) job even though I can't stand the people I work with, make enough money to provide luxuries for me and my girlfriend. I have stuff, good health (physically) for now, hobbies (that I no longer enjoy), good credit, never been to jail. Hell, I've travelled recently and marked some things off on my bucket list. I can even afford to help others out when they need it.

But I still feel dead inside and want to kill myself. This world depresses me, I don't care for politics or TV in general. Everyone's fake and trying to sell something. People constantly take advantage of my sympathy and generosity. I don't believe in a god/gods, religion is a tool for the corrupt to take advantage of and profit off the more simple-minded. Life seems pointless, nothing has a purpose, nothing means anything... But I think I've figured out why:

Friends and family.

They must be what I'm missing in my life. They're the most necessary thing for true happiness, right? I find myself getting jealous/envious when my girlfriend goes out with her friends or spends time with her family. We humans are social creatures, always striving for acceptance and a place to belong. Reasons to live. I used to think I was ok with being a loner, but I no longer think it's possible to live a happy life this way. So I've been thinking about moving out of state to somewhere I'll hopefully fit in better, maybe out west/northwest. I can't do anything about my family (or lack of), but maybe I can at least make some better friends somewhere else.

Problem is, my girlfriend doesn't want to leave her friends and family behind, and I don't want to force her to make a choice between me and her folks here. I'll also miss my sister, although getting away from my dad will make it a lot better and maybe I can convince her to leave, too.

I don't want to hurt my girlfriend and sister, I just don't know how much longer I can bear this... I'm headed toward being that 30 something year old guy who suddenly hangs himself for seemingly no reason.

Any advice? Anyone who can relate? Please don't give me any of that sugarcoated feel-good bullshit, I've heard enough of that... And no, I haven't sought out professional help, but that's because I don't trust doctors. Most are in it for the money and don't give a shit about you, and fuck those zombie drugs made by evil pharmaceutical companies. Just looking for some opinions, please.

Last week I asked him if he wanted to meet up during the weekend and he said he couldn't because he was going skiing.

Earlier in February I was the one who asked him if he celebrates Valentine's Day. He got the hint and said he does and will make reservations for the 16th. February 16th comes around (last night) and he didn't text me at all. I messaged him around 4:30 and asked if we were meeting up and he texted back that he couldn't make it tonight. I asked him ""why?"" and then sent another text saying ""I'm just asking because it doesn't make sense. Earlier last week you said that you were making reservations and now you can't make it and not giving a reason."" He deleted me everywhere and blocked my number.

Basically all Mike says here is that they aren’t going to deliberately have like auditions essentially for a new singer but he isn’t opposed to the idea of a replacement for Chester. He’s basically softening the blow for the fans. He doesn’t want to outright say they are going to replace Chester with a new singer because a lot of people would be immediately against it like myself. So he’s trying to ease it in. He’s testing the waters. Someone will be singing for LP within a year trust me.

I always feel inadequate and like people hate me and I fear rejection and abandonment more than anything else. I've never really got to the root of these issues but I finally realised where all of this comes from.

I was pretty much bullied in middle school. Not physically and only occasionally verbally, but I was very much always excluded. I was the weird kid nobody wanted to hang out with. I probably went through some of the hardest times of my life when I was between the ages of 12 and 14, and I was always entirely alone back then.

I was just violently thrown back to those times. We're doing a collaboration with another course at uni and the people from the other course were supposed to team up between themselves to help out my class with our individual creative projects. One of the course organisers just emailed me.

Nobody picked me or my project. I wasn't anybody's first choice.

And I was just violently thrown back to being 13 and terribly alone and rejected. I just stopped having an intense emotional breakdown. I'm currently dissociating and can't really access my emotions right now - it was really really really painful.

I've never made the connection before. I've always doubted myself a lot and thought that surely everybody hates me. Surely I'm always the weird kid. Surely I'm never anybody's first choice. I have extremely low self-esteem and social anxiety.

Never allowed myself to realise why I think that way. Don't really know what to do with this knowledge right now. Will probably discuss in therapy next week.

I just thought she was out there having so much fun with other people and I felt so terribly alone and abandoned that I just cried and stared at her chat on messenger to see when she would be online to respond to my messages (I was convinced she was ignoring them and I sent one every hour) and she never responded.

She explained later that she literally just hadn't seen them but I still can't believe it. I think she was ignoring me on purpose. I think that everyone I know hates me and they don't want anything to do with me.

Anyone else relate? Can y'all offer suggestions on how to be more of a functional, independent human being instead of my mood depending 100% on what other people are doing? :(",guess fall social anxieti recent learnt therapi also top gad sorri categoris symptom right disord lol flatmat part bigger friend group everi time hous alon think rest friend purpos exclud yesterday exampl cri two hour make class friend due therapi time came home flatmat yet get back sever hour thought much fun peopl felt terribl alon abandon cri stare chat messeng see would onlin respond messag convinc ignor sent one everi hour never respond explain later liter seen still believ think ignor purpos think everyon know hate want anyth anyon els relat all offer suggest function independ human instead mood depend peopl

Anyway, I go to therapy about my anxiety and other, uh, issues, but for some reason I find it really hard to share one symptom of my anxiety, which also causes me really really really huge anxiety (in a really annoying cycle) - which is my digestive system.

Basically a few years ago I used to be extremely afraid of throwing up. I was sure I had emetophobia and idk maybe I did? Not sure, but like I had just started high school and I had to take the bus to get there and I guess my nervousness about having started a new school manifested itself as being afraid of throwing up on the bus. I would also be afraid of attending any big events and talks at school where I had to sit still for a long time because I was so sure I'd throw up and embarrass myself. I don't have that anymore though - it went away by second year of high school.

Now I'm at my final year of uni and let's just say that 2018 has been absolutely awful for me, and I'm really struggling with my mental health. My anxiety and depression are worse than they have been in the past three years. Now all that has again created another weird and specific digestion related fear and, honestly like you can laugh at me for this because it's ridiculous, but I'm terribly afraid of farting in public. I can't sit still in class or lectures. I can't have a movie night with my friends. Because I get anxiety attacks. About the possibility of farting.

I think it's all because my stomach is all kinds of fucked up, probably as a result of anxiety but also sometimes, occasionally, I've also suspected if I have IBS, lactose intolerancy, or what have you. And the idea of public embarrassment just becomes too massive in my head, as some sort of a weird diversion from all the other things that should be causing me anxiety, like my final project at uni for example.

Another ridiculous side note: it doesn't help that my crush is in the same class (I'm doing an art related degree and our classes aren't that big so we all know each other) and I can't even begin to handle the idea of embarrassing myself in front of them like that, which makes my anxiety about it worse! I'm pathetic, I know.

TL;DR I'm really fucking afraid of farting in public and I've been skipping class because of it and since I can't talk to my therapist about it, I'm here now.

She then explains she loves casual dating and is seeing some other people (I don’t have a number). I asked if she dates anyone “seriously” just to date them and she says no and she doesn’t lead anyone on if that’s what I’m thinking. But we’ve been texting everyday, and have been together three times. We’re going to hangout Friday and Saturday this week. 

At what point do I pull the plug? I’ve been in relationships, and always, it’s been, ok you like me or you don’t. Is this new school dating? I’m not a fan.

I've just recently started to realize that maybe my daydreaming is too excessive to be normal. I would just blame it on my ADD and not being able to focus because of that, but I've come to find out it has to be more than just that. I know this is usually caused by trauma, and the only thing I can think of is seeing my parents fight constantly throughout my childhood, before they split. I would escape into my own little world, playing with dolls 24/7 and then I'd find myself creating different worlds in my head when I wasn't playing with them. Everywhere I went, everywhere I looked, I'd imagine these characters I made up, living their lives and going through their own dramas. I'd search different clothing and places in the world to add detail to my visuals. It was never-ending, and it took a toll on my grades and made teachers annoyed with me in class. 

I eventually grew out of those specific scenarios though, and created new ones with a purpose; I began writing my own novels using details from my daydreams. This led me to believe that I was just a creative person, and all writers must have this wild imagination and giant passion for it, that never seems to shut off. These days, I don't write as much, but instead I do role-plays with my friend over text. I'm 18 and it feels like an embarrassing 'young fan' thing to do, but it's just the way I channel my daydreams and ideas. I can also play The Sims for hours on end because it's like the video game version. 

I have social issues because of this, too. My friends are always looking at me funny and telling me to snap out of it when I'm constantly staring into space. My family members have also caught me smiling to myself or whispering under my breath. Getting asked what I'm thinking about or who I'm talking to, makes me feel crazy. When I'm alone though, I freely talk and laugh out loud at whomever I'm imagining myself talking to in whatever scenario I've made up. I don't make up characters anymore when I'm not roleplaying; I just see actual people from my life. My ex is usually my main character most of the time, and as you can imagine, it's very annoying and makes me feel over-obsessive; but I can't stop it.

He contacted me after Christmas, with a hint of desperation to talk to me. Instead of ignoring it and blocking him like my friends begged me to do, I lied to them and spoke to him, anyway. I wanted the chance to just put all my thoughts out there and then tell him I wanted us to forget each other. That I didn't want him to keep contacting me every few months and making me fall again, just to hurt me and disappear with another girl.. over and over. But, I didn't do that. I ended up asking him why he always came back the way he did (he has her so I don't get how I'm of any significance), and he suddenly opened up to me about how much I meant to him and how throughout the past two years he hasn't been able to let go of me. He expressed all these feelings for me and talked about his pain and how he drinks too much and wants to end his life, and how the only thing I ever made him feel was happy. I didn't know how to end it anymore. I started to comfort him, but I told myself we'd just be friends.

Stupid mistake. We spent the whole week talking, and I told myself I wouldn't eat up all the sweet nothings he'd say.

I don’t expect anyone to read or respond to this, but I appreciate anyone who does.

i’m in therapy, I go every week and I talk to my therapist and I do all the “homework” she gives me and I’ve been doing it for a year and yet I am in a worse place now than I ever have been in my entire life. I see a prescriber who disagrees with my diagnosis and doesn’t know what to put me on because the last thing he tried I had a horrible reaction to and missed two days of work. I’m trying, I am trying really hard.

I miss my husband, I hate him for everything he’s put me through but I also still love him and it’s just really painful. We signed our divorce papers almost a year ago, and I just can’t let it go, I can’t even feel better about it, I can’t move forward the tiniest bit. He cheated on me, he treated me like shit, he deliberately triggered a massive panic attack to force me into signing the divorce papers before I had a chance to even read them, let alone try to get representation. I should just hate him, I should be glad he’s not in my life, but I miss him so much and I feel so empty without him. also he’s not totally out of my life and sometimes he’s randomly really nice to me and it fucks with my head, but there’s a part of me that thinks it’s better than nothing to have him either treat me like shit or be really nice to me or ignore me, depending on his mood because at least I still get to see him once every couple of months. Although we have to be very careful to dance around the fact that he has a girlfriend and I know he has a girlfriend, but he still won’t admit to me that he cheated and is still with the other woman. 

I can admit that the divorce was largely my fault. I have a tendency to throw a tantrum if things aren’t perfect or exactly the way I want them and I am just never ever satisfied. I can’t imagine being married to me, it must’ve been miserable. In a way, I don’t blame him for cheating on me. I did try to fix things. I tried really hard to be mindful once I realized how difficult I was being but it’s so hard to see your own behavior that way so it took me too long to realize it and I can admit that. Once I did though, I tried so hard to be thoughtful and to stop doing the things I knew bothered him and to make sure that he knew how much I loved him, but it was just too little too late I guess. I’ve never been good enough for anyone in my life, everyone has always left me, and my husband was no exception. A large part of the reason I act the way I do is because I’m so afraid of being abandoned, and it makes me act crazy. I’m just a really terrible person, I hate myself. 

my sister bailed on me too, we had a really shitty childhood and it was always us against the world. My mom is a psychopath and she ruined us both, but I never thought my sister would turn on me. The second I had issues and needed help and it wasn’t all about her she completely cut me off. I had always hidden my issues from her, I didn’t want to burden her with my problems. I have one relative who I still speak to (who lives 3 hours away and just wants me to fucking be ok already) and no friends, I am so alone and there doesn’t seem to be much reason to keep going when no one would care if I was gone. You always hear people say it’s strong to admit you need help and ask for it...but what if you have no one to ask?

I have a bad back, I have bad skin, I’m unattractive, I have a bunch of horrible decision tattoos, I have scars all over my legs from self harm, I have broken teeth and a bunch of other dental issues that I need to have fixed, and I don’t have the money to deal with any of it. I also suffer from chronic pain, and of course the multi-pronged diagnosis that no one can seem to agree on as far as mental health. i’m in pain every day and I can’t see how anybody would ever want to be part of my life in any capacity, I don’t want to be part of my dumpster fire of a life, why would I ever ask anyone else into it? But I am so miserable being so lonely. I’m just not built for it. I miss having someone to share things with, someone to cook dinner with, run errands with, sleep beside. I miss just those little things so much, without them life is so empty and worthless. 

I hate my job, it makes me physically sick it’s so stressful and so awful. I barely make enough money to pay for my apartment and my apartment isn’t very nice. I hate the town I live in, I hate everything about the way I live. i’m ashamed to ever have anyone in my apartment, I keep it clean, so it’s not that. my neighbors are loud, my things are old and I am making do the best that I can with things that are broken or ugly or otherwise awful. I still don’t even have all of my things from when I lived with my ex and at this point I doubt that I’m getting them. I still have bookcases in boxes that I haven’t opened because I’m not strong enough to put them together and I don’t have anyone to ask for help.  

I also don’t drive or have a car, so I feel like there is so much I can’t do or get for myself and I am so limited as far as looking for new jobs or places because I don’t know how I would get to interviews, etc. I have to rely on public transportation and I have extreme anxiety about it in so many different ways, every day I have to leave my apartment is just hellish. They are also talking about cutting bus service to the area where I live, which would mean I would have to walk to work, which is doable, but we have pretty extreme weather here and a 45 minute walk in 0 degree weather on ice for half the year and in 100 degree weather the other half doesn’t sound very appealing. Not being able to take myself where I want or need to go when I need or want to go there makes me feel so useless and helpless and trapped. 

I don’t like for people to see the way I live, it’s pretty obvious when you walk into my apartment that I don’t take very good care of myself, I eat like shit and I’m used to being all alone. it’s all set up for someone who doesn’t feel well most of the time to not have to go very far to get the things that they use the most often. I am in my 30s and my apartment looks like I’m a child, I have toys and collectibles everywhere. I like them but they embarrass me. I’m ashamed of who I am and how I live. 

there is nothing about me that makes me an attractive partner or friend. I’m not talented, or funny or entertaining, I’m not particularly nice or generous or gifted in anyway. I’m not smart or a really good person, I’m ugly inside and out.

I have started drinking again. I feel like going to the store and buying wine or beer is like putting my toes at the edge of the cliff and leaning back and forth, but if I went in and bought vodka it would be admitting that I am finally going to jump. I have been suicidal for so long I have no idea what it would feel like to not wish I was dead. I tried to kill myself once before with pills and vodka, I woke up covered in bruises and dried blood in a puddle of vomit, with no memory of getting out of my bathtub. I sat on my floor and sobbed, I was so angry that it didn’t work, that my body saved itself in a black out stupor. I cry most mornings now, waking up and realizing I’m still alive and have to drag myself through another monotonous, joyless, painful, boring, lonely day. The only way I can sleep is if I mix pills I’m probably not supposed to be mixing, usually with either alcohol or marijuana or both. 

Without love, without hope, without anything to hold on to what is the point of staying? No one would even notice I was gone. The strongest emotion anyone would have would be irritation and that would be my ex-husband having to clean up my mess and my coworkers being short staffed. No one would actually miss me, my company, my personality. No one would be sad that I was gone, in fact I think most people would be relieved. I am difficult to deal with, I know I would be relieved to not have to deal with myself anymore. there’s not a life I’ve ever touched that was better for having me in it, most people I’ve known would’ve been better off if they had never crossed my path.

My place is much smaller than where I was living and I don’t feel safe by myself. My cats are not adjusting well and making me feel so guilty. I just don’t know what to do. And on top of all of that I am so cripplingly lonely I just want to die. Does anyone have any tips on how to make being alone more bearable?  I don’t want to feel like this forever, my mind just running on loop of how terrible I am and how fucked up my life is. I am tired of this horrible pit in my stomach and not being able to sleep.

I mean, life just feels like one big dreaded thing after the other, and not this exciting adventure, and I don't even know what needs to change to make it not feel like a big waste of time. I try to change the way I see things, but no matter how much I try to consciously tell myself the positive side of things, something subconsciously or just deep inside my head does not believe it, cannot accept it, does not feel it. 

 It's a fucking trip. On some level, I hate that I just complain about these fundamental issues about myself, but I'm not able to logically figure out how to solve them. I feel like a helpless moron, and I hate that I'm even in this position. Nothing anyone says about it feels like it has any weight, and I feel mentally retarded because I can't even really understand what exactly I'm thinking about any given thing in the moment to be able to logically combat it. Even with self reflection, there is something deep inside me that just does not want to submit, does not want to follow what others say makes life worth it, does not want to just accept what others think of it.

My brain can't legitimize/validate the thoughts of others on this. I can't feel it. I don't know how else to describe it. I just want to ride life on autopilot because of my anxiety and ADHD, but living like this, with no direction, is also somehow deeply unsatisfying. 

I don't know man. It feels like something is broken deep within my head. It makes me lose all faith in what my life experience will be, and it makes me regret what it had already been, since I guess I've lived like this since forever, but I guess I was too dumb to understand how bothered I was by it, to understand my problem at all, or whatever. It's like I'm not truly capable of having a deliberate, rational, logical inner dialogue. 

My opinion on the days or anything else feels like it has no weight in how I feel about my life. A lot of the time I generally feel like I don't have much of an opinion at all. I feel apathetic, unless something is happening to induce negative feelings of anxiety or depression. Really. I've got this inexplicable disconnect in my head between myself and reality and my emotions. I don't understand it. 

But the thing is, I don't want to explain myself to others. I don't want to have to explain myself to a therapist or other professional, because I'm afraid they just won't get it, and so their opinion or advice on the matter will be incongruent with what I'm trying to convey. I think I'm probably also just too lazy, but maybe this is also a function of my anxiety. I also don't want to take meds man. I don't want to engage in what is essentially a science experiment with my own brain, just taking stuff until I find something that works. I don't want to deal with the money aspect of it all either, never knowing what is and isn't worth it financially speaking. I guess I could justify it in that regard either way, to take meds or to not. I just don't want to deal with side effects, and possibly losing a part of myself that I'd rather not live without. I mean frankly, I'm talking about my sex drive specifically, but I suppose there are other things about myself I also wouldn't want to lose along the way. 

Depression and anxiety are a bitch. I wish they didn't have to be something that's a part of me, but fuck, I grew my developing brain within the context of them. I fear they are just a part of me now, and that because of it, nothing in my life really matters anymore.

I hate trying to form bonds with them that I'm too dead inside to really give a shit about. Hell, who am I kidding? I'm not even trying. I don't want to try. I don't want to be close to anyone. I don't want to have to hide the way I live my life because it's just not a respectable way to live. I hate everything about trying to connect with people. I hate having to be self aware all the time about what I'm doing and how I look, etc, etc. I hate feeling emotionally connected to another person. It's too much. I don't want the kind of weight and meaning love brings into people's lives. I hate feeling that I'm essentially inferior to others. I will never be able to rid myself of this concept because I'm not willing to work on myself or find reason to be proud of who I am. I'm not interested in having that sort of accountability for who I am or for what my life is. I am dead inside. It doesn't matter what I do to waste the time. Booze and porn is the only thing I live for. It isn't enough, but I don't have the mental capacity to actually engage with anything in life in any meaningful way. I never have been. I'm too dead inside and it makes me more angry and resentful to have to find entertainment in other things, because 
I literally can't do that. I probably have a severe anxiety problem because I can't bring myself to face any of life's challenges. I'm too afraid of them. I don't want to confront all of the different problems and responsibilities in my life. I don't want to become confident. It's too overwhelming to try. I don't even want to take that first step. I don't give a shit because I'm a coward. I'd rather die than turn my life around or prove myself to anyone or myself. I'm not interested in asking why I do the things that I do. I just don't give a shit, because I don't want to. I can't handle my life having any sort of meaning. That's the truth of it. I can't handle it and at this point I'm too jaded and broken for anything anyone has to say about it or life I'm general to have any impact on me. I am not inspired by anything. My eyes can never be opened to alternative ways of looking at things in a way that I intellectually think is actually valid. There's no anecdote that would make me feel any different, no philosophy, because for a long time now, emotions don't come into the picture. You can't make me feel better because my emotions no longer dictate how I think about life. It's how I think about it, and how I think about it has completely clouded any way I could possibly see life in any aspect in a positive light, outside the scope of anxiety. At this point I'm not interested at working on looking at things differently. To me, it's all pointless, because my rebuttals are actually valid, just not in the sense that the goal should be to get back to ""happiness"". Well I don't care. I'm too dead inside. It feels safer to be this way. It feels safer to give up and then die. If I give up, I can't be all that disappointed, and maybe I'll get closer to having the courage to die on my terms, in fact, I know I will. And when I die, I will be delivered from this world, from all the responsibilities of this world, free from everything. I wish my life didn't have to be so meaningless. It fills me with anger. Burning fucking anger. But I'm not willing to give it meaning, for all the reasons mentioned above. All I'm left with is burning anger that this is the way life must be, that I'm not allowed to escape the people in it, or the responsibilities, but after all of it is over, there is nothing. Why did I have to exist? There is no reason, and I refuse to give my existence a reason, a purpose, because I'm too much of a coward, and I'm not interested in giving my life any weight. I'm not interested in reminsicing on the past. I died a long time ago. Fuck love. Love is stupid. Love is madness. Love is cruel. Love is fucking nonsense. It was never meant for me. I was never meant to live on my own terms. I was never meant to live out my dreams. Instead, all I got was to see how lacking I am in so many areas, on a natural fucking level. To think I could do anything I really wanted to in life was foolish from the get go. I'm not interested in living with the reality of who I am, of what I am. All I want now is to die on my terms. I don't give a shit how happy or unhappy anyone else is, the fact of the matter is that so many of them, the majority of them, were able to do what they wanted, lived how they wanted, loved who they wanted, because  their lives naturally gravitated them to those things. I'm not willing to deal with the disappointment that my life will always be, and I'm not willing to accept the cruel and in all likelihood only at most half true statement that it is actually my fault that my life is so dissapointing. I can't even reasonably expect that what comes after death will be better than this shit. Life is cruel and it fills me with such a fucking rage. I want to destroy everything in this world. I'm not willing to accept the way things are. I'm too much of a coward to deal with hardship. I'm just fucking pissed and there's nothing I can do about it. Nothing that I am willing to anyways.

I don't want to be more responsible. I don't want to get more involved. I don't want to be more curious about how everything around me works. I don't want to plan for the future or really work hard to provide myself with a decent future. I don't want to give to others. I don't want to figure out my appearance. 

Really, I don't want to be engaged with life anymore. I don't even want to be alive. I'm fucking sick of the answer always being ""self respect"" which you need to actively work to self improve to acheive. I'm not interested in sitting down with a therapist and looking into what it is I need in order to respect myself and to find ways to acheive those things. I'm not interested in being held accountable for it. 

Life just fucking sucks. I'm fucking tired of having to earn the respect of the people around me. I fucking hate it, because it's always about what they want, and not what I want, the latter of which really doesn't fucking matter, because I don't want anything anymore, or at the very least, I don't want anything to do with other people.

There is nothing here for me beyond sexual, pornographic pursuits, slaving away at work for money to spend on nothing important in particular, and becoming inebriated when I feel like it, which generally means after work.

This is all my life will ever be. I'm okay with it being that. But eventually I will have to deal with other people not being okay with that. I'm not interested in appeasing others by providing them with what they want from me, even if it is in my best interest to do so. I don't really give a shit how immature that sounds. 

I don't like to think that I'm entitled, but I guess I am in a way.

Everything is pointless now. I'm not interested in the kind of humility life demands from me. 

This is all a pointless experience. I can't feel grateful for what I have. I'm not really grateful for anything. I like to think I am, but I don't actually feel it until everything is gone and it goes to shit. I'm sick of learning life lessons that seem fundamentally petty, even if they are practically useful. I've no interest in real life anymore. I don't give a single shit about how what I do effects anyone else.

 I don't give a shit about the pain my death would cause others. I would rather them have to go through that, than me having to go through life and all that it brings. I'm sick of being made to feel like I am a piece of shit due to the choices I've made. 

No, I don't have a plan to move out of my parent's house. No, I don't actively expect anything from them, or even passively. I don't get anything from them except a house to stay in and I guess health insurance? Whatever. I don't exist to make my parents proud or to make anyone proud for that matter. Pride is stupid. Pride is petty. Pride is useless. I'm not proud of myself, but I don't really care to be either.

Your probably thinking ohh he probably just got addicted, or maybe he od’d. Neither. I was using cocaine for 2 months. Only 2 months. I have used MANY other drugs in my past and abused them alot. But cocaine i absolutely loved. It was amazing. The feeling. My friend would come over with a ounce of the best blow you could think of and just give me coke for free. And i could get spoted as much as i want. So let me speed up this story. On the second month of my coke addiction or whatever you want to call it i started feeling weird, i could not play video games on cocaine or my heart would just race like crazy and i would sweat alot so i stoped playing games while using coke thinking id be fine and maybe games were maybe just making me anxious on coke. But boy was i wrong, my body was warning me to stop. One night my friend comes over to drop me off some kush and some coke of course. Hes over were both smoking doing lines and i get this weird feeling out of the blue, i start sweating really bad and i get scared i tell him i think im oding, my heart is racing so fast but 3 hours later it goes away. I never gave a fuck about my life so i thought who cares. Next night he comes over again. I use coke. Not even a hour in my heart races and pounds so hard you would be scared for me. Also i got really intense chest pain. I don’t go to hospital. Friend leaves about 5am. I stopped using coke. But it didn’t matter. Ever since then (6 months ago) i get the most, worst, scariest pain in my life in my heart all the time. It hurts so bad i cant stress it enough it litterly feels like my heart is being stabbed over and over. This has gone on for 6 months. And this is the worst part, i have had multiple tests done and nothing has came back bad. So im stuck with this unknown condition. Also my heart will randomly pound and race out of no where for absolutely no reason at all. My chest is never not tight and it always feels like there is a 100 pounds on my chest, and just to make this clear i promise you on my familys life this is NOT anxiety. I have had to say that so many times. Ive had anxiety for years this is absolutely nothing like anxiety, my life is ruined because of coke use. If you closed your eyes and felt the pain i did you would be so scared for your life. So you may be wondering why i wrote this? I wrote this because if this post can stop one person from using coke just 1? Ill be happy. Think about it. If this can happen to me. This can happen to you. And you do not want to live like me with a unknown illness especially at my age. Oh and to mention i cant smoke cigs or weed anymore or drink (it will trigger my pain) and i smoked weed/cigs drank for 7-8 years. Please don’t use this drug. Please like I’m begging you please quit or don’t use it. It ruined my life. Don’t take your life for granted like i did.",pleas read here stori cocain ruin life probabl think ohh probabl got addict mayb od neither use cocain month month use mani drug past abus alot cocain absolut love amaz feel friend would come ounc best blow could think give coke free could get spote much want let speed stori second month coke addict whatev want call start feel weird could play video game cocain heart would race crazi would sweat alot stope play game use coke think id fine mayb game mayb make anxiou coke boy wrong bodi warn stop one night friend come drop kush coke cours he smoke line get weird feel blue start sweat realli bad get scare tell think im ode heart race fast hour later goe away never gave fuck life thought care next night come use coke even hour heart race pound hard would scare also got realli intens chest pain go hospit friend leav stop use coke matter ever sinc month ago get worst scariest pain life heart all time hurt bad cant stress enough litterli feel heart stab gone month worst part multipl test done noth came back bad im stuck unknown condit also heart randomli pound race absolut reason all chest never tight alway feel pound chest make clear promis famili life anxieti say mani time ive anxieti year absolut noth anxieti life ruin coke use close eye felt pain would scare life may wonder wrote wrote post stop one person use coke ill happi think happen happen want live unknown ill especi age oh mention cant smoke cig weed anymor drink trigger pain smoke weed cig drank year pleas use drug pleas beg pleas quit use ruin life take life grant

I've been seeing psychologists/psychiatrists since I was about 15, I've been on a bunch of different medications for just as long and I've been in hospital twice yet as every year passes I just seem to get worse. Nothing helps.

I feel like I don't get enough help from the people around me and that there isn't really enough help available. I'm struggling with university (after having dropped out 3 times), I'm unemployed because I can't work retail and there's nothing else available, I have no friends, I have no hobbies, I have a bunch of physical symptoms which make it hard to even get out of the house. It feels like the world is against me sometimes. Disability support at uni is useless and my university's expectations are really high (and on top of that just getting there is a 3 1/2 hour round trip), employers always want a million years experience which you can't get without a degree (and even then it can be difficult), my psychologists don't really help, medication does nothing, and most of the doctors I go to don't believe anything is wrong with me physically because I have health anxiety (which is not completely unreasonable, but it's also really dismissive and my symptoms just keep getting worse).

I really only have my mum and my boyfriend for support but my boyfriend is busy all the time with university and my mum is essentially useless and probably a lot of the reason why I'm so mentally ill. I don't get proper support from anyone even if I do ask and it feels like this world doesn't want to help people who are disabled. I just feel so shitty about the world in general; everyday I see all the horrible things that go on in the world and it makes me even more distressed and depressed. I feel so incredibly hopeless about anything. 

At the moment I just think about suicide everyday. I've started self harming a lot more. I don't see any way out of my situation. If therapy doesn't help, meds don't help, hospitalization doesn't help (and isn't really possible because I only got to go last time through increased insurance which I don't know that we still have). How am I supposed to get better? Why can't I get better? Why does it seem like everybody else can take a magic pill or go to a few therapy session and somehow they're cured? That's the only narrative I seem to see about anxiety and depression...that the hardest part is seeking help and admitting you have a problem.

Every session she just brings up the stupid ""bus"" metaphor (if you're not familiar with it: [http://rosspsychology.com/blog/the-bus-metaphor](http://rosspsychology.com/blog/the-bus-metaphor)) but it doesn't work for me. She brings up the bus metaphor in relation to my lack of motivation and my physical illnesses but I can't just ""accept my feelings and do it anyway""; I'm exhausted, I feel physically ill all the time and I just have no motivation to do anything, i can't just force myself. It feels like this method of therapy is just a fancy way of saying ""just do it"", like all the laypeople tell people with depression to do anyway. ""Just get out of bed"", ""just eat healthy"", ""just exercise"", ""just be happy"". Maybe she's a shit therapist, or maybe I'm interpreting it wrong, but it just makes me feel lazy and hopeless, like my shitty life and my struggles are all my fault. It doesn't feel helpful, it makes me feel alone like I have to do everything by myself and I can't get any help with anything, which I guess is true but isn't part of the point of getting help for mental health to actually have people...help you? Not just tell you to ""do it anyway"", but to give you constructive strategies to get things done, or even services that could help you? I don't know. The whole thing made me feel so bad. Meds do nothing, and my only hope left was therapy but that just seems like a lost cause too. I feel more hopeless and pathetic than ever before.

I don't relate to any of it and I've been that way since high school, people in my grade would always be throwing parties or going out to drink or whatever and I'd always feel like a loser because I don't really drink and I don't do drugs...

It still makes me feel like a massive loser because I don't do those things. I feel so insecure around other people my age.

What defines an abusive relationship? I think I was in a abusive relationship with my ex of a year. We broke up last novemberish and havent contacted each other since. I should say I'm a 19 year old Male and she was a 18 year old female. Anyways, I think she was emotionally, sexually and physically abusive towards me. Emotionally because she would threaten self harm if I left or to hurt me if I left, always wanted to be near me and wouldn't let me hang out with friends/would physically and verbally assault me if I did, she even threw me into a wall before. (I'm about 5'7"" and 110 lbs and she was 5'5"" and 160ish lbs. I didn't do anything cause shes a girl plus I've never been that strong anyways.) She constantly would touch me and practically force me to have sex with her. I was asleep with her one night and she sat on my face while I was asleep (she was naked) I'm straight but I woke up to that and couldn't breathe as she was literally sitting with all of her weight on my face. Would you call this an abusive relationship? I'm still fucked up in the head from everything, it got to the point where I was severely depressed, and constantly had panic attacks for months that ranged from 15 min to nearly an hour. I still do and am still really messed up in my head and physically from it. She even gave me an STD, mono and strep throat (so bad I didn't eat at all and barely drank anything for a month, leading me to wind up in the hospital several times in one month.) She also cheated on me several times. I should preface that I've been raped twice by strangers, and sexually/physically abused in the past by my father.

Moon drunk monster
Beautiful and strange
Howl your melancholy question
And tell me
Which you dread more
The echo or the answer
There is no pack that the lone wolf will call his own
For the strength of the lone wolf is his and his alone
From the shadows to moonlight he climbs upon high rock
For he shan' t call upon no one to help,
Nor on Heavens or Hells door he shall knock
From upon high rock, he deems an enemy everything in sight
For the only companion of the lone wolf is the silence of the night
There is no howl heard from lone wolf, by silence he wishes to be embraced
And the shadowy path is all he sees, for he knows it is his fate
And from high rock he climbs down
To the shadowy path he walks on his own
For the strength of the lone wolf is his and his alone

Then over a period of about 2 weeks, I got antibiotics and I thought those were laced so I stopped taking them. Then I convinced myself that food and drinks were laced as well. But I forced myself to eat and drink. Was also having regular panic attacks daily, mainly at night. Sometimes multiple in a row. I'm still not smoking, but I have gotten better with not really being bothered by the thought that food and drinks could be laced.

You gotta sacrifice several years of your life to college and most likely go into debt just for a chance to apply for better jobs. Not even a guarantee. And you better hope you picked a marketable degree. If you choose not to you can work a regular job you'll likely hate the rest of your life dealing with inconsistent scheduling and a-hole/b-word managers. You can always leave for a different job but it's like the saying ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" as in the next regular run-of-the-mill job looks good but will have it's own set of problems, usually of which is guarenteed under-payment at any non-degree job.

Then there are relationships. This is the big one because it's what life seems to be based around. Movies, books, music...even certain video games. Higher-ups at companies know this is what most people strive to achieve at all ages of life from teenager to death in fear of ending up lonely so they take advantage to make more money since that's what makes the world go 'round in their minds. Better pray you're not born ugly or your options are going to be rather limited. Some people grow desperate while others just simply get tricked into ""falling in love"" with someone who treats them nice for a little bit but ends up breaking their heart. Not every relationship will fail but most do unfortunately. The chances of picking someone attractive, smart, kind, caring, fun to be around, and having high morals is incredibly slim. Of course there are many that appear to have these traits but simply can't hold true to them.

In my day to day life I'm a relatively reserved person, though I usually have no problem talking to people in regular situations and can make friends easily. However, I just cannot for the life of me get good at public speaking. I suppose it's the introvert in me....

As a result, this has always been something I have avoided because all my memories of doing it end the same way. I always look, sound, and feel super nervous when it's my turn to stand in front of everyone and talk for several minutes. It's embarrassing and makes me never wanna do it again.

Unfortunately, I'm in college and gotta take a public speaking course. In my first speech I did very badly, easily the worst in the class. 30 seconds in I fell completely apart. I was talking way too fast, I was breathing super shallow, and I repeated my main points rather than going into detail because my brain felt crazy at the time. 

Ironically, my written part of the speech was pretty good, I just couldn't get the words out right. My second speech.....I did something I shouldn't have. I skipped class so I wouldn't have to give it. I never skip class but my heart wouldn't stop beating a thousand miles an hour so I went to the bathroom to calm down. After about 20 minutes I decided I wasn't calming down so I left school, depressed at myself. 

I don't want to do that again. I want to get past this fear of mine. From what I've researched I'm apparently activating my ""Fight or Flight"" adrenaline response in my body due to past experiences which sucks as I have no idea how to control it.

The modern versions of Banjo Kazooie and Tooie are on Xbox so in another way it makes sense to get the spiritual successor on the same system. I've heard it didn't run that great at launch but maybe they patched the Xbox version since? It's around $20 or so from what I've seen.

I've had homicidal thoughts on and off for a long time, but in recent years it's taken a new direction. I feel so fed up with life, so alienated, so worthless, so misanthropic that the ultimate fantasy right now is to go on a small spree and end it with suicide by cop.

Firstly, I'm not in the US so I can't get a hold of firearms, but the thoughts I have revolve around different ways of murder - arson, stabbing, that kind of thing. In light of recent tragedies I even felt a sense of excitement seeing numbers of people killed. Reading into events of great bloodshed and violence sends adrenaline through my body. The higher the death count, the more intoxicating the high.

This kind of hatred and sadism is something very new to me. I was a sweet kid growing up - never hurt animals, never showed any signs of psychopathy or sociopathy, or any mental illness other than extremely low self-esteem and suicidal depression. I was kind, sensitive and never took any pleasure in seeing people in pain. Yet, I've become a complete and utter sicko. What other kind of person could look at triple digit death counts and think ""that's impressive?"" But this is where I've ended up. 

A couple of years ago I had threatened and even planned on killing my own father but that obviously didn't happen. Still, that was much tamer compared to the kinds of thoughts I'm having now. I can't deny that part of me wants to be the villain of my own story and leave life in a way where nobody will want to remember me, but for now I have it under control and even if I didn't, I don't have the means to do anything for a while.

I can't exactly blame all of them, cos nobody is perfect. People have bad days, and people are hot and cold kind of by nature. However, a huge chunk of my childhood memories are of people turning on a dime and treating me weirdly. I have vivid memories of peers and carers would snap at me over things I didn't even realize were a problem. Asking someone who called them on the phone and being responded to with a look of total outrage and disgust, being told to ""mind my own business"" is a standout, because I was a preschooler at that point, and the person who said that to me was my carer at the time. I can still see the face she made at me in great detail. I must have been 3 or maybe a little younger. Then, throughout school, my friends would randomly choose each day if they were going to exclude me and call me names or treat me like everything is peachy. This continued in high school with heightened intensity. There's more to it, being treated as second-rate student by teachers, being blackmailed by the vice principle for having the gall to ask for mental help, and more that I can't really go into.

Now, I struggle to trust if people like me or if I'm about to be treated with utter contempt. I can't trust my perception because my internal dialogue turns into ""what if I've missed social cues and they're uncomfortable? Have I made a mistake? Will they snap at me?""

I don't wamt to imply that my parents are at fault, but just want to analyse how my parents actions unintentionally caused me harm as I grew up.

From a young age, some of my earliest memories are of my parents insulting or talking poorly of people - usually someone on the road who isn't driving perfectly or some other thing that could be chalked up to a mistake made in the moment. As a kid I didn't fully understand and assumed my parents must be right. In my brain at the time, of course that guy at the lights who took a second to notice the green light was a bad driver. Of course the waiter who misremembered a small part of an order is hopeless and useless. Kids think in black and white ways, but as I grew up I learned what it meant to self-analyse. The problem is that because of the views I had inherited from my parents, my analising quickly turned into criticism and doubt. When I realized I was capable of making the same mistakes as people my parents often wrote off as useless and bad, I started to apply that sense of perfectionism on myself.

My parents, for the most part, don't criticize me like they criticize outsiders, if that makes sense. That didn't stop me as a child from developing low self-esteem. I applied those perfectionist attitudes to myself and was upset whenever I didn't live up to them. When I was around 7 I remember having anxieties over not being my idea of what a ""good"" and ""normal"" person, who doesn't make mistakes. Going into high school, these thoughts metasticized into a complex. As time has passed, I became hateful to myself over this train of thought. Now, whenever I see my parents insult others for mistakes that I know I can (or have) made, I feel a palpable sting inside, and I realized at a certain point that I think ""they're right, I'm hopeless.""

Does anyone relate to this? I don't believe they were abusive, but their way of talking about people and judgemental attitude had an impact on me. It has as much to do with me and my weird ways of thinking as a child, as much as it has to do with how they spoke. Or, that's how it feels. Does anyone have any thoughts?

I could try to make some changes in my life, but I'm too weak willed to follow through on anything that might make me feel better. It's made people angry at me for being too lazy and I've even been called ""a fake depressed person"" who is using depression and suicidal thoughts as an excuse to be lazy and belittle ""real"" depression. I can't even argue with that, honestly. It might be true. I don't know why I am this way, so I can't guarantee that I'm not just lazy.

I don't know what to do. I've been told the only answer is to just try and hope things get better (by my psychologist and my doctor). Maybe I make some progress in the short term, but I crumble in the medium term because I'm miserable, and then I don't try again for months and months.

Specifically with vacations, despite all 3 of us being unemployed (dad has terminal kidney failure, mum is his carer, I have no escuse lole). In 2015 the 3 of us went to Japan. It was an amazing experience. What I didn't realize at the time was that it got rid of most of our savings. Despite this, dad went back for a week with a friend a month ago to see a band and plans to go again next year.

Cut to now, and we've applied for community housing. It's doubtful that we'll get a placing by March when our contract is up with our rental (that we can only barely afford rent for atm) so all 3 of us will probably be couch surfing in the very near future. If mum and dad can't find a place to be together, then they'll be on the street cos mum has to take care of dad's health and medication. Worst case scenario I'll be surfing my friend's couches. 

But the part that makes me feel utterly miserable beyond everything else is how my parents have pissed away our lives to this, and for what? Some temporary fun in a foreign country? And they have the gall to tell me that I spend too much on myself, when I only spend $20 a month on non-essential stuff for crying out loud. Worse still, when they get some money back, mum and dad plan on moving up north ASAP. 

My parents kept me dependent on them and never taught me any life skills, pissed away their money, got us homeless and are planning on bugging out of state cos they feel like it. They assure me they aren't abandoning me cos they'll call me. Yeah, cool, doesn't change the fact that you've acted like I'm nothing but a fucking burden for the last 5+ years and are going away without me.

I can't get up before 11am and despite ""trying"" to change that for years I never force myself to change. There's nothing left for me to look forward to. All I have in my future is homelessness and being even more of a drain on the ones I care about than I already am.

Me and my ex were in a relationship for about 4-5 months. Not sure about specifics, but it was long enough. It started around April or May of last year and it was the first relationship (and to this day, the only relationship) I was in. We are also both guys, I should note. We were smitten for each other and shared our first kiss together and all that sappy stuff. Unfortunately, we ended up being dreadful for each other. We are both very very depressed people and no matter what we tried to make it work, we pulled each other down into the other's misery. In the end, I was the one who approached him and asked that we go back to being friends. He agreed and said he felt the same way as me. We told each other that if we got better, then maybe we'd get back together at some point. In the end, I got over him (or thought I had, anyway) and he got over me.

Fast forward to now. He is in a new relationship and is truly happy for the first time since before him and I got together. His depression has gotten better, his insomnia and chronic pain is now under control, and he's in love with a girl now. They connect better than we ever did and he's doing better in every way.

So why can't I feel happy for him? I thought I was over him but now whenever I see anything about his new relationship it tears at my insides and I curl up and want to die. I couldn't sleep last night because of it. I feel a mixture of self-loathing and self-pity that has me completely confused as to what I'm feeling and why I'm feeling it.

All I know is that it hurts more than I ever expected to know that what we had isn't special anymore. I can't talk to anyone about it either. I hate that I feel so fucking messed up about the situation, especially when I was the one who suggested we break up. Combined with everything else that's stopping me from going out and finding a new partner (poor mental health, no job, no confidence etc) this makes me feel even more hopeless and pathetic than ever.

Sorry if this isn't the place for this, cos I mentioned this to a friend and she said this is just a normal thing everyone deals with but I haven't seen or heard anyone talk about this before.

In conversations, especially with (but not limited to) people I think are cool and I want to like me, it's common for me (at least once a day, sometimes more) to completely sieze up with anxiety and just not know what to say. My thought process usually goes ""oh crap, what should I say? Should I try to be funny? Should I try to be non-chalant? Should I say nothing?"" If I try to be funny in that situation, I usually end up saying something cringeworthy and awkward, when I try to act normal I act kind of hyperactive and on edge and when I say nothing I've been told that's pretty awkward as well.

I'm wondering if anyone relates and/or how you guys handle it. Any tips on how to deal with those kinds of situations? Cos when I get into that situation I know that pretty much anything I do (or don't do) will come off as awkward. It's a weird and unpleasant feeling and it's lead to some very very awkward moments of embarrassing myself and unintentionally making other people uncomfortable.

To preface, I deliver appliances for a major hardware store. I'm not a big guy (5'4"" 130lbs) so it's very odd to have someone so small work this position. I managed to work myself up from this weak thing to actually being able to hold my own to where a fellow coworker even pointed out how far I've come since I started the position a year ago. For the past couple of months, we've been really short staffed so we've had to take associates that work in the store with us drivers for help. This one particular associate that's been helping, though he's a great person to talk to, is a HUGE klutz and doesn't quite understand most of what we do but acts like he's been doing the job forever. Well, I happened to get hurt due to said associate not knowing how to properly move something and I'm currently on desk duty till I can see a doctor.

It's been two weeks since this happened and I'm miserable. I'm tired of my crutches, I'm tired of feeling helpless. More importantly, I'm tired of the head manager of my location blaming my small size on the accident. He said ""You know, you're not the biggest guy. Maybe taking the appliance apart would've helped you guys and prevented the accident"". I didn't know what to say so I just stared at them. Then another associate said ""You know they expect us little guys to do so much when really we can't"" and it just hurt because goddamit I can move shit just fine! The accident was from an associate unsure of what to do that shouldn't have been out with me to begin with and stupid porch steps on these damn new houses!

An associate that works in the store, but in my department got hurt to a far less degree and they are very Narcissistic. I'm not gonna go into detail, but they are very dramatic about their injury so I'm trying to make sure no one thinks I'm trying to be like them so I'm keep my nose down and just trying to do as much as I can within my restrictions so I've caught myself doing way too much and becoming exhausted,  but again, don't want people thinking I'm being dramatic like the associate so I keep going. 

My head has wrapped around to maybe everyone is right. I got this job to further my driving career and get my CDL, but now I'm seeing that me being so small is just a burden. Maybe I should just leave before anything else happens. To top it off, I don't know when I'll be back doing my job so it feels like it's already over. Maybe I should just go back to what I was doing where small people deserve to be.

This time I was graciously gifted the Gen 3. I was looking forward to this one since they made some obvious changes to the design and size (Gen2 OG 5"" Gen3 4.3""). It looks like it would really combat the current issue with my Gen 2 where it's tearing just a few inches inwards on the shaft due to constant bending when packing. I will be judging the Gen3 against the Gen2 since it is a different model and I use the Gen2 primarily. On to the review:

&#x200B;

**Shipping & Packaging:** Shipping was very quick. Order was placed on a Wednesday and got it on the following Monday. Maybe I just got lucky and they happened to have my color ready. When I purchased the Gen 2, shipping for that was fairly quick as well so I'm not surprised. It came in a white box and inside that was the Emisil packaging. I love Emisil's boxes just because they are so fancy looking (you're spending hundreds on these and it really shows with the box). I will say, I don't enjoy how on one side of the label, it says 'Prosthetic Penis' but I live with my fiancee so it was no issue. I did have to sign for it so be weary of that. I could tell they improved their plastic packaging. This time it was in a air tight bag with the Gen and color stickied on. Much improvement.

&#x200B;

**Look & Feel:** Now this Gen is to more resemble a flaccid penis and it shows. It's much smaller in size and it looks soft. It's not so veiny as the Gen 2 which I like a lot since it looked like I was half erect. Texture is the same as the gen 2, That roughish silicone feel so it's very stiff sadly. I'm not a huge fan that it's stiff in the downward position. Makes bending it up harder and with how my gen 2 tore, makes me worried that this gen will tear at the top due to bending it. I wish it was a bit looser since silicone tears very easy when bent the same back over and over again. Has the same floating Testicle design so you can feel hard balls inside it when you squeeze it. It felt like the sides of the testicles are thicker silicone which is good if so since that's the first spot on my gen 2 that got a hole. The design of the testicles is really nice, I love the flaccid relaxed look it has. The tab is much taller and wider on this version which I absolutely dislike since it's long enough now to show above my pant line. I've heard people cut there's to better suit them, but I haven't tested it myself since I didn't want it to affect my harness. I can wear this version much better with loose articles of clothing since it does sit in the downward position. This model also has the 'anti-leak' so the rim around the funnel is curved in so it can't overflow.

&#x200B;

**Wearing w/ Glue:** Due to everything that I dealt with on the gen 2 and the glue, I didn't feel comfortable trying glue again so I just stuck with my harness.

&#x200B;

**Wearing w/o Glue:** I use a Peecock Jockstrap for my harness. Since this version is smaller, it's much lighter. I've grown accustomed to the gen 2's weight so to me it was too light. Felt like nothing was really there. I did like how it sits so now I'm not walking around with half an erection, though since the shaft is stiff downward, it doesn't move which is unappealing. I liked feeling it bounce against me combined with the weight really helped with the dysphoria. The back flap is much thinner causing it to collapse when I'm moving around so it pops out of the harness a lot more then my gen 2 did. Sadly with the constant dysphoria, I wasn't able to wear the Gen 3 for long periods so I didn't get to test it while I worked. There, I'm stealth and I just didn't feel right without the weight and the movement so I only wore it when I was home and did small shopping trips. I know a lot of people dislike harnesses, but after some time, you really get used to them. I Don't even feel mine anymore since I wear it so much.

&#x200B;

**Peeing:** Now, I just want to start by saying that a good amount of people I've talked to, have said this Gen works for them and the gen 2 didn't. That's fine, some work for some people, some don't.  I could not get peeing with this thing to work. It just kept getting stuck under the lip then spill out. I never mastered it and I grew more and more frustrated with it. It never acted as a funnel. It was a flat disk against my body that would push out some urine the right direction, but most of the time, it just couldn't and spill out the back. It didn't help that the urine had to practically get up and over the hill to go out of the penis side. Even with tilting all the way forward, I always spilled. I never made it out of the house let alone my bathroom clothed. I was frustrated. I was so looking forward for this device to work, but I was beaten by it. But again, to some people it worked, but I guess I'm too used to the Gen 2. I have had it for nearly 2 years now so I'm not surprised.

&#x200B;

**Cleaning:** Anytime you take a shower, some dawn dish soap and let it stand up to dry.

&#x200B;

**Playing:** This version does have an erection rod, but that's more for aesthetic. The Previous Gens are more for playing since the Gen 3 can not bend up to perform.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** I was really looking forward to this version due to the changes of the stance and size, but it just could not work for me. The tab is too big, the funnel doesn't act as a funnel, the lip catches the urine and spills it out, and it's way to light for me. Positives being they are moving in the right direction with design, silicone felt thicker in the problem areas, the device itself still looks absolutely amazing. Will I still buy from Emisil? Hell yes, my Gen 2 is still kicking (after some silicone glue bought from the hardware store and amazon). I hope to get the smaller Gen 2 at some point. Do I suggest the Gen 3? I can't say since I couldn't get it to work. It could work for you, but you won't know till you try and with the price point, it's touchy to just buy something to try it.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Though the device looks amazing as ever and the company looks to be moving in the right direction when it comes to design, I could not urinate with it due to the funnel not really funneling and the device being too light and stuck in position for me. I've heard of other people enjoying their Gen3, so I must just be used to my Gen 2.

Moved up to Head Cashier pretty quick since I had previous experience from another job. In the new year, I moved to be a Delivery Driver at another store. Now, when I applied, I honestly didn't expect anything. I did it on a whim and because since I was already trying to get my CDL, couldn't help to get some experience in it. Luckily, the manager that interviewed me saw potential and hired me. Even mentioned that once staffing got back up, I can train for my CDL. 

I'm not a big guy. 5'5"", 130lbs. I'm tiny and obviously I was worried that I would be booted my first week since I was gonna be too weak. To my surprise, everyone just kept saying ""You'll get it, we're not expecting you to throw a fridge the first day"" and they all helped me. As the weeks went on, of course the reality of the job set in, the high expectations from management started to take a toll on me. If I got a nickel for every ""You got this"" after explaining that my truck was overloaded AND I was going out of town so I could not take that dryer the customer bought the day before. \*sigh\* My first manager did nothing. He was a buddy to all of the other guys and it disgusted me since they got away with so much. He was soon let go and the new manager approached me one day asking what I want to see from him. I told him straight up that I don't want a friend. I want a manager. Be nice, that's fine, but my coworkers need a manager in order to do their job right. From that point on, things were fixed, department was organized, coordinator position was introduced. Of course with the stress of delivery, we had a high turn over rate so that meant no training for my CDL. Whatever. I've done my fair share of mistakes (just cut tree limb vs side of truck). 

At one point, I was informed I was doing damages to customers' product. Now, I was taken back by this. Mental breakdown (Long story), manager didn't mention anymore of it, and I guess I got my shit back together since I've never been talked to again. Trained my fair share of new drivers and new riders. Even one driver that literally didn't know he would be lugging a 28cu ft fridge everyday. Done plenty of overtime that I'm now an expert at filling out the Driver's Log. Had my fair share of mental breakdowns when the day is just not going my way. I've come to hate the summer and not for the heat. All of my rider's know how I run my truck and how each stop goes with me. They know how I communicate and to not. Touch. My Tools.

Out of everything bad, I was really shown something good last week. On New Years, I had just stopped for a quick 30 before stopping at a pro customer's house that I knew would just give us a code. Second my rider hopped out to head inside the gas station, my phone rang. My mom was doing a group call with my sisters and I. She was calling to inform us my Uncle passed away. I was hit hard and in that moment, I knew I couldn't finish the day. Called my manager, told me to bring the truck back and go home. Had to work the next two days, a fellow driver covered for me. A manager offered to use some time I had saved up on one of the days I missed so I got a little more than just a day and a half on my paycheck. In that moment, I couldn't be more thankful for my coworkers. In that moment, I felt the Lowe's family.

In my year of being in this position, I have been bruised, beaten, cut, yelled at, berated, cut-off, used, hose down, covered in drain pipe shit, crushed (looking at you awkward front porch steps), etc. But I am grateful for it all. I'm grateful that I have a job, that I'm gaining experience in a career I plan to dive into, I'm grateful that I was given a chance to prove myself. I can't see myself going back out onto the floor ever again. I dread the days I'm in the store. To anyone looking to get into Delivery, it isn't easy. It's fucking hard, but man the stories are great. You can meet some really awesome customers and see really cool houses. You can meet some hoarders and houses the size of a coat closet. The summer is Brutal, the winter is slow. French door fridges suck, 18cu are treats. You'll learn how to flip a door on anything in your house and you'll never be able to step foot into a house again without judging what size fridge can fit in it smoothly. 

Thank you Lowe's for the job. Thank you Managers for giving me a chance. Thank you coworkers for being my family in my time of need. I'm not sure how much longer I plan to stay with the company especially since some markets no longer do in house delivery anymore, but until then, I can see a couple more years especially for my CDL.

Sadly, she was only .7lbs and warned us she would be euthanized since she was so small. We decided to take her home and either get her up to weight so she could be adopted or keep her. We have 3 other cats and needed another girl to even out the herd so we were leaning more towards keeping her. As the days passed, we noticed she wasn't doing too well. She was lethargic, uninterested in everything, ate very little, and didn't have solid bowl movements. Tried dewormer from the emergency vet, but the next day (today) she plummeted. She wouldn't walk, eat, drink, her feces was tar like. We took her to our vet. They gave her medicine to perk her up so she could get some food in her. 2 hours after we got home and it got worst. She wouldn't move anymore. Went limp in our hands. Then she started showing signs that it was time. We raced back to the vet and luckily enough, they didn't make us wait though they were packed. The vet saw us and we just told him that it's time. We cried hard, we cried so hard for this little kitten that was in our life for not even a week. We tried so hard for her.

A little background, I work as a delivery driver for a major hardware store. I've been in this position since the start of the year and though I really enjoy it, it gives me anxiety really badly since appliances are very expensive, heavy, and houses are not built to take these in and out easily so we have to be very careful. Since my anxiety is so bad, I'm extremely careful and anal-retentive about each stop and some of my coworkers hate me for it since I'm not rushing to get home like all the other drivers. In turn, those drivers get a lot of damages on their heads and hearing about their fuck ups helps me become extra careful. Now on with the story.

So I go into work today feeling okay. I'm off tomorrow and I knew it was going to be a quick and easy day so I went in with no issue. I was hearing around that everyone in our department was to get a raise. I had myself set on talking up my raise since I have much more training than anyone else and have done all of this extra stuff for my department.

I do my first few things in the morning before starting my route when my manager wanted to speak to me. Now, I should also state, a week ago, I made a booboo and caught a tree on one of our trucks. There was no way to avoid it with where my truck was at, it was either the side of the truck or run into the customer's other tree and his fence. It made a good size gash in the truck so it was getting repaired. I immediately texted my manager pictures and explained everything. Did drug test since I was driving, blah blah blah. I finally came down from the attack that caused after my manager talked me down explaining things happen, it'll be ok. Well, he starts off by asking me if I wanted to guess how much it'll be, I openly admitted I didn't want to know. 

He starts telling me numbers and I can feel my face go white. I knew it was going to be big and I felt like shit for doing what I did, but had he stopped there, I could've easily been able to go through my day, but he continues. He tells me this past month, my customers' have been calling saying I've damaged their items. He has gone out their personally and looked and confirmed it was something we would've done. May it have been a dolly, strapped down, hauling it in, whatever. All he said was it didn't look like a customer did it themselves just to get a discount. He's telling me the damages are in the thousands. Now I feel myself shaking, starting to choke up, tears welling up. I was mad, upset, confused above all since I KNEW I wouldn't have gone through a delivery with a damage and not noticed it. I will beat myself till I've worked 9 days straight to make up for a small scratch on a fridge. I do NOT let myself forget a single damage. I strap everything down with every protection I could find. I will restrap what my rider has done if they didn't do it up to my standards. Hell, I stopped letting my riders take stuff in anymore even if it's heavy (I'm a small guy) just so I know it's going in safely since they don't give a damn (and in the end I'll get the blame for it anyways). I've also never seen our dollies do damages to items. They have rubber padding on the side where items get strapped to and have never dealt with it. I started shaking my head no to him. I told him how everyone knows I'm anal about each and every stop and all he says is ""I know, which I find weird all of this is happening, but I just need you to be careful from now on"". All I could do was say ok. If it would've been a more private setting, I would've demanded to see pictures, know the customers just so I knew, but all I could say was ""Ok"". He finally tells me that it's just between me and him. No one else knows, not even the store manager.

My first few stops, I tried to hold back tears. I couldn't help but run through every single stop I've done this past month and think back on damages I could've done. My blood pressure was probably at a dangerous level, but I couldn't stop myself. I texted him later saying I didn't want my raise, how I didn't deserve it. He calls me an hour later saying how I can't back out of my raise, I deserved it. He then says how shit happens, it'll be fine. We'll just keep it between us and it'll be ok. All I could say was ok.

I've never told him I have anxiety since there was never really a time to tell him, but I feel like he can tell. He knows I'm beating myself up right now and he's trying his best to calm me down, but I can't help but think that I have customers that are seriously just out for a quick buck and I'm getting the shoe for it. I thank him for calming me down, but goddamit, I need answers! I can't live with the fact I left my customers with a damaged item!

I was hoping to getting on anti-anxiety medicine so I could calm down, but this just makes me not want to get on it since I feel like I'll be too lax and fuck more shit up. Since I can't talk myself out of the raise (that I still feel like I don't deserve), I just won't talk it up even if I feel it's too small.

Partially due to a busy schedule and laziness, other part due to wanting to really get a full feel of the product. I have had my Emisil for almost a year now and use it nearly daily. This review will be long, but I'll try to throw in a TL;DR at the bottom.

**Shipping & Packaging**: I was not excited about the shipping times since I'm very impatient and have really bad bottom dysphoria. I was getting frustrated with my freetom and was really excited to be getting this next big thing. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived a couple weeks earlier than expected.  It was shipped through DHL and I got a phone call and texts from the delivery driver before delivery which was helpful since I was at work. My fiancee was able to sign for it with no issues. It came in a plain brown box and inside was a chic black box with subtle writing covering it. Inside was a welcome slip and the device itself. The inside box was like a phone box where you had to lift a flap to reveal the prosthetic that was protected by plastic.

**Look & Feel**: The look of the device was absolutely stunning. I got S04 coloring though I'm fairly pale and it looked very good against my skin. Testicles are movable in the scrotum in what felt like a gel like substance and you can feel a ball in each section. The material wasn't sticky like most STPs out there. Because the silicone is different than most, it was a little stiffer which bummed me out a bit since when I use it, pulling on the shaft means stretching it. The top flap that is used to hold the extra glue was a lot thicker than I would've thought so it was pleasant. It had some weight behind it due to the testicles having gel and the balls, but it wasn't too heavy. I was comfortable with it after a couple days. Another thing with the texture, I've only put corn starch on it a few times and it has never gotten sticky like most prosthetics. It is a very comfortable prosthetic and I'm pleasantly surprised. It is rather large if used for a packer (5.5"") but sits comfortably with boxer briefs or briefs. I cannot wear this with loose boxers due to it looking like I have semi and it bounces around. I prefer tight underwear, so it was no problem for me.

**Wearing w/o glue**: I use a peecock jockstrap harness to hold it in place. The harness kept it tight against my body and was very comfortable. I have a physically active job and I didn't have any huge issues with it that made my dysphoria freak out. Only few things I would encounter was that if I jumped out of the back of my truck, it would bounce a little making it so I had to readjust myself though nothing too out of the ordinary than when a cis man has to readjust. My newer straps would sometimes cause the funnel to slip through the big pocket especially out of the laundry due to the elastic being strong, but a quick trip to the bathroom would fix it. Only encounter this issue a few times (maybe once every few months). Nothing too major for me. I got use to the feel of the straps and it just feels like wearing underwear anymore. The few times I feel asleep with it wasn't too bad, though the elastic would be stretched a bit due to a days use, so it would need to be readjusted in the morning.

**Wearing w/ glue**: Now I bought this due to the thought of using it with glue. Everything that the prosthetic would be touching plus areas around it would need to be shaved as well. I bought the glue emisil suggested at first, but it was really sticky. Almost like a gum and I did not like that one bit. Made everything very sticky. And I mean EVERYTHING. It was not pleasant. It was very hard to remove the glue from the prosthetic and myself. No matter how many showers I would take, the glue would still be on. It was terrible. Feeling bits stuck to each other was terrible and having to mess with it was absolutely hell. Then it would never stay in place. I would have to hold it in place for up to 30 minutes to dry just to get a good maybe hour of hold, just for it to start to detach not long after. I decided to try a different glue I found other people suggesting. Pros-Aid. That stuff was a lot better. The solvent on it worked a lot better too. It was more of a liquid and a little went a long way. It held longer and was much stronger though I would still run into the issue of the back of the funnel (that was attached on the lower buttocks) would become unattached after a few hours of wear. That was a huge issue since then I could feel it bouncing off of me which would cause me having issues with my dysphoria. I tried sleeping with it a few times, but it wasn't comfortable. The constant shaving and having to reapply was really taking a toll on me, so after maybe a month or two of the glue, I stopped applying it and just used the straps. I will admit, it looked amazing just seeing it attached to me with no straps. It looks real. If I was good at make-up, I could easily blend the top flap making it look seamless. 

**Peeing**: Urinating with this device is really good. After years of using STPs, I still have to relearn how each device works. The funnel empties pretty quickly and you can easily one hand it. All that's needed is one hand to push the back end of the funnel (close to the buttocks) flush against your body to seal the funnel. A small tilt forward and your good. Now, I still can't use when I have been waiting to use the toilet since then I'm unable to control my flow, though I have gotten a lot better. If I feel like I want to stand up, but want to be able to sit if I feel like I might leak, I'll use a stall. A good 90% of my day urinating, I can easily use a urinal with no issues. Once you get used to controlling your flow, it's pretty easy from there. It becomes second nature. When I'm done, all I need to do is to do a few tugs and push up on the back of the funnel to make sure everything gets out, but with the way the funnel is tilted, a good portion flows out evenly. The stream is strong and acts very normal (whereas the freetom is less strong due to the head you have to squeeze to allow it to flow). I've even had times where it split like a cis mans and man was that a trip. This thing is so real looking, I have found myself hugging the urinal less and less since I feel that if someone catches a glimpse, it won't look unnatural. If you use straps, use your clothes and hand that's holding the back of the funnel as a way to hide the straps. 

**Cleaning**: Everytime I take a shower, I clean it as well. I keep a thing of Dawn dish soap to clean it and it works really well. 

**Playing**: This device can be used for playing if you purchase the rod, but I chose not to use this device for it, so I cannot review this portion. 

**How it looks now**: I've had this thing for almost a year and it still looks great. I have noticed some of silicone around the testicles have rubbed a bit against my legs causing it to 'shed'. That has caused some paint to come off, but nothing too major. I noticed a small tear on one side of the testicles and it bums me out since silicone tears easily once it starts. I've kept wearing it daily after noticing it and it hasn't gotten worst to my surprise. Even with my physical job, it hasn't gotten worst. I have purchased a silicone repair kit from freetom and plan to repair it. The paint is still strong and still looks very real.

**Conclusion**: The price is a lot ($600), but it is worth it. I haven't kept using a prosthetic more than a year due to becoming detached by the way it looks. This one still looks very life-like and works great. Only a small tear, but even with constant use, it hasn't gotten worst. It is easily fixable. Paint is still strong, everything is still working, my dysphoria is still pleased. I highly recommend this product if you can stomach spending that much money. It is highly worth it in my opinion. I could buy a new prosthetic due to the tear, but I feel like I still have a lot of use still left in this one so I plan to repair it and keep going. I have thought about trying Reelmagiks version since they have an uncut one (which I prefer), but the reviews I found on emisil was better and I do not regret my decision.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask :)

**TL;DR**: This prosthetic is very life-like even after a year's use. It's better to use it with a strap due to glue being very unpleasant and not being strong enough. It detaches at the bottom of the buttocks that can cause dysphoria to freak out. Only a small tear on testicles has appeared, but has not gotten worst after constant use. Will be repaired. Price is high, but it is worth it if you can spend it. If you have questions, feel free to ask :)

I selected 'Made to Order' since they didn't have the color I wanted in the 'Already Made' section.

**Shipping**: I ordered on the 16th of January and it arrived late February, early March. Took about 20 business days. It was hard to wait that long, but honestly worth it.

**Look & Feel**: This is the most beautiful looking STP I've had so far. I didn't get the paint upgrade since I wanted to save some money. This STP is under $100 and it looks amazing. I got the 'Tan' color since they say to choose darker than you natural skin. I was kind of worried it might be too dark, but it's much brighter than I thought. Pictures at bottom of post.

**Packing**: I use the [Peecock Miracle Jockstrap Harness](http://peecockproducts.com/index.php?_a=viewProd&productId=36) and it holds it comfortably to me. I love a slight bulge, but not too much and The Buddy does it nicely. My fiancee says it passes the squeeze test (she's biased though, haha) and I like grabbing it to adjust myself. Feels natural. I tried wearing it with just tight briefs and it doesn't do it justice. The silicone is very soft so it collapses under it's own weight and slides around. The harness I have linked is very comfortable, recommend it a lot.

**Peeing**: I got cocky. I figured that since I've had a STP before, they are all the same. They aren't. Take your time with each new STP before you waltz into a public restroom. I gave myself some time. Stayed calm every time it would dribble out the back. You have to press the back of the bowl against you and lean a little forward to make sure it goes forward. The bowl is a little bigger than the Peecock, but don't let it fool you. Freetom added the new Urethra  opening which makes it so you have to squeeze the head to get the flow going. It's not hard to get used to, just some time need to know how much pressure gets the steady stream. A couple times I'll get it dribbling down my fingers, but nothing too annoying. The stream isn't very strong which is what I liked about the Gen 2 Peecock, but it's fast enough that it won't overflow instantly (looking at you Gen 3s Peecock). I'm able to use a urinal easily as long as I'm wearing lose enough pants since I have to adjust it to square up with my junk (walking will move it around obviously, so make sure to square it up before releasing the cannons). I'm still working on making myself not look like an awkward hunchback when standing there since one hand needs to be down by the back of the bowl applying pressure while the other hand is squeezing the head and my head is corkscrewed to make sure it's coming out in a steady stream (I hug the urinal enough so if anyone walks by, they can't sneak a peak since the straps might be a little obvious). I've learned the signs on when it might leak out the back so I'll either do a little jig and readjust or shuffle into a stall before there's a mess. So far though, I've had 4 successful trips. I'll do the [Butter's Stance](http://i.imgur.com/Ztl0DfC.gif) if it feels like I'll have trouble at the urinal, so I'll opt for a stall.

**Conclusion**: For the price, it's worth it. You will need to buy a harness since briefs don't hold it securely. Keep an open mind on the shipping. I don't know how fast they are now they only have 'Already Made' items, but be ready for it to take a while. I don't know if I might buy from them again. I plan to get a Real Magik once I have the funds and The Buddy can hold me over nicely till then.

He’s the boyfriend of one of my best friends who I can usually talk to, and honestly, I took it personally. I mean, I was under so much stress and going through so many hard thoughts at the time and I was just trying to get a little escape and joke around, but this is what I get.

I don’t want to be salty, but I can’t help it now. I mean, the only good thing that has come out of all this is that my crush (usually insulting the other guy) came out and defended me. Now I see why he hates him so much. Yes my crush can sometimes be a jerk, but at least there are reasons and it’s usually not a personal attack like this.

If you want some backstory, in the past I had defended the guy (not my crush) because I respected him deeply, now I don’t even want to be around him because of the way he’s repaid me for me standing up for him.

Just a rant, I needed to get this out somewhere.

TLDR: I’ve had a different kind of crush than ever before in that I care for his needs (like big life stuff) so much and that it’s really not about me, but it’s about helping him. Is this a true and honest love or simply another false one?

I(a female) mean, I’ve liked a lot of guys before. It’s gone from long term crushes for the wrong reasons to a quick spark of love where the flame is immediately put out. 

Now it’s different. I’ve known him for a while, and even though I hadn’t gotten over someone else yet at that point, I still thought he would be a good influence on me relationship-wise. And yet, I still hadn’t found that personal connection yet (he’s a little shy and not very open personally without a good base that we hadn’t quite gotten at the time).

Then after witnessing a crap ton of his drama and looking into him as a person, I want nothing more that for him to be happy. Yes I like him (how could I not?), and when I logically look at everything he’s put out there, I shouldn’t feel this way, and yet I do.

I’ve found attraction in him (Something I’ve never experienced simply from seeing the person behind the face). I’ve put his needs and wants forward over any logical level because he simply deserves the best. Of course I want to be with him, but it’s not really about me. It’s about being there, and I try to be there for him in any way I can because he needs someone who will. All I want for him is to be loved and to be happy, and the fact that it’s not about what I want in the slightest is what’s different.

I’ve never been one of the “cool kids” and I’ve been very introverted and stuff like that. A bit more recently, I’ve been trying to be and express myself a bit more and try new things since I’m in high school, and it’s the best time for doing that. I still have the same friends from middle school though, and they’ve seen me grow.

I’m not doing some super crazy stuff (well, it is a little for me), just like putting braids in my hair (I wore my hair down 99.9% of the time) and wearing skirts more often (it was just a no back then idk why). One of my friends is kind of similar in that way. She’s an awesome person, super smart and has a great personality, and she has a certain comfort zone, like I am trying to get out of, but she’s starting to emulate me in a way.

I mean, I’ve never had people admire me at all, and it’s kind of weirding me out. One day I saw her wearing braids (LITERALLY NEVER HAPPENED ONCE), so I complimented her. She then told me she did it because she saw that I did it and thought it was nice. Then, I started to wear skirts and she complimented me (actually really changed a lot of people’s views on me just by changing my style, but that’s for another day), then, the next time I saw her she wore a skirt too. She said it didn’t even fit her, and it was actually her mom’s, but it looked good so I complimented her. 

I’m just starting to see a pattern, and I don’t want her to try to be like me just to be like me because she’s already a great person, and she should follow her own path. Also, it’s kind of a weird problem for me.

TL;DR- A friend of mine is emulating me now that I’m expressing myself more freely, and I want her to just be herself instead of like me.

Idk if there’s advice for this or what but I just wanted some kind of insight.

So this week has been hard for me because my friends got into a lot of drama and I had to go to school even though I was sick. So I half jokingly said “I kind of want to die” (I’m not suicidal I just have a bad habit of talking that way to say that I feel depressed) and my friend actually asked me why like he genuinely cared about my well being. So I began speaking about all the bad things happening and he couldn’t even listen to me for more than three seconds before getting distracted. So now I’m in a super depressive state (way more than normal) because it feels like I’m not important to others. That on top of everything else has just been putting my depression at an all time high.

So is there anything I can do? Can I speak in a way that can keep there interest?

Sometimes I imagine if you were to tap me with something you would hear a sound come out like what you hear when you tap an empty glass with a spoon. 

The ironic thing about this world is that it tells you you deserve reciprocal, intimate, sexual, skin-to-skin contact only so long as you have something to offer in return. As soon as you cease to be of use, well you’re shit out of luck and you might as well be dead because there are 3.5 billion other men on this planet and there are plenty better ones to choose from. 

And let’s not kid ourselves, if I were one of those 1% alpha males who gets whatever he wants I wouldn’t be giving a shit about any of this and I would be rejecting girls left and right enjoying life to the fullest.

The truth is that all people are animalistic, hedonistic assholes deep down and all we really want is for ourselves to be happy.

But we shouldn’t blame ourselves. Life itself is alarmingly pointless, utterly meaningless, and disturbingly purposeless, so what else is there to do but make ourselves happy? 

When I started college I somehow literally hit the jackpot and my beautiful best friend at the time and I “fell in love” (quotes because love isn’t actually real) with each other and that became the one and only year of my life I have ever enjoyed, I did not manage to lose my virginity (and never will at this point) but I came as close as I am ever going to get and at least got a taste of what it might feel to be “happy” in the sense that normal people are able to be happy. 

Now I know that that is never going to happen to me again because i have a warped and disgusting view of humanity as a whole that will prevent me from ever trusting or developing a meaningful relationship with any other human being ever again.

But even if I didn’t, I am a toxic and despicable person who drove her into a depression relapse where she was hospitalized after her family found her lying in the bathroom. Thankfully she is still alive but only god knows how she is doing now.

I sincerely hope one of you reading this runs me over with a car one day. I want it and I deserve it.

Quick backstory: My dad is an asshole who won't help and only does things his way, and if it benefits him. When we moved into our house, I was 14 and there was a built-in dresser in my new room. I really wanted to keep it because I thought it was really pretty but my dad for some reason said I couldn't. So he tore it out and had a new (old) one built in. For some stupid reason, he had, and still has it in his mind that it was the dresser being bolted/built in that I wanted, not the original dresser itself. The one he put in was used, old wood and while it was probably very nice when it was made, it wasn't going to last much longer when I got it. It's now 10 years later and I need a new one. The bottom two drawers don't close and I can't move it to clean under/around it so when our new kitten peed on it, there was no way to get the smell completely out and now our cats continue to pee/spray there. I clean what I can, but I can't clean it completely. I'm fed up with it. I've been asking for about 3 years now for a new dresser for Christmas and birthdays but my dad always shuts me down and says it's impossible to get rid of the old one because it's bolted in.

TLDR; My dad says I can't get a new dresser because my old one is bolted into the wall.

&#x200B;

My moms side of the family has had many cases of both IBS and colon tumors/cancer. When I was younger, I had a bit of IBS but when I started eating a mostly vegan diet, that changed and I've had regular BM's ever since (about 6 years). Since then, I've had only one day where I was constipated and I remember having quite a bit of cheese the day before. Every day I have my regular BM at about 9am with an occasional second one in the evening. 

&#x200B;

A week ago, I was asked to help my dad out at work and this caused a lot of anxiety and it's when my constipation started. It wasn't too bad at first, and when my anxiety went away a couple days later, I was fine again. But then very shortly after that, I started work and was too embarrassed to have a BM there since everyone in the building can hear (very echoey) so I held it until I got home but it wasn't very satisfying and seemed like I was a little constipated. This happened basically every day last week until Friday when I had some light diarrhea and had a cold until today which is Sunday. 

&#x200B;

I'm still feeling constipated and haven't had a regular BM for about a week now. A couple times, there has been bright pink blood on the toilet paper when I wipe.

For about 3 days now, I’ve had a pretty painful hangnail. The change in weather has made my skin dry so I think that’s the main cause.

I’m not sure if it’s infected or just irritated and I’m not sure how to fix it/help it heal.

If I’m not wearing shoes, I don’t feel any pain unless I’ve just messed with it or hit it on something but with shoes on (so all day at work) it’s pretty sore. I’ve been cleaning it as best I can and putting ointment on it with a bandage. I clean it when I get home from work and after I shower and before I go to bed I take the bandage off and rinse it a bit so it’s not completely moist all day from the ointment.

It hasn’t gotten worse but it’s not really getting better either. Do I need to cut it off? Just let it heal? There hasn’t been any puss, the wetness around it in the pic is from the ointment.

I'm going to be working from 7-12 for a couple weeks, though. I don't want to take a full on lunch since I'll be home by lunch time, but since I'm waking up a little earlier and will be doing more than usual, I think I might need a little fuel between my coffee and my lunch. 

I like to stay between 800-1,000 calories. I'm an adult who is 4'10 so that's a pretty good amount for me, especially since I'm trying to lose a little weight. I like to have my coffee, and then both lunch and dinner are 400-500 calories and I'm usually pretty satisfied. 

Does anyone have any ideas for a decent snack that's around 100 calories? It doesn't need to be \*too\* healthy, but obviously healthier is better.

I really love those almond butter/coconut Clif bars. Thing is, they're a little high in calories, especially for how small they are. I've been slowly losing weight and have been feeling good about myself, do you think eating one of these a day for two weeks would throw me off track?

I'm having to help out at my dads work for a few days.

I really hope I just get at least one day to prepare. I'm having so much anxiety over this, all it is is scanning papers. I'll have to say hi/meet a couple people I don't know but it's only for 5 hours a day and it's not any sort of important work I can mess up on or anything. I don't really know why I have so much anxiety over this. I think maybe deep down, because I'm 24 and don't drive (my brother will be driving me there since he's working too) and don't have a real job, I feel very judged by everyone and I'm always afraid people are going to ask about my life and I'll have to tell them I'm a failure pretty much. I know I shouldn't care and people are annoying to ask in the first place, but it happens.

I don't have a job at the moment and don't have a license. I've had jobs in the past, my longest one being an assistant in the office of where my dad works (not helping him, he's not in the office) but it's been a while since I've done that and at the end of last year, my bi-monthly dog/house sitting job ended because the people moved. 

I've been working to get my license more so than ever now. I've had my permit a couple times but never fully felt comfortable enough. I have a lot of anxiety so it's hard to conquer. We had really bad weather for a while, but now that it's clearing up and it's day light out longer, I feel comfortable to get my permit again. I just need to study and take the test. After I do all that and get my license, I'll be able to get a job. Hopefully at my local craft store haha

&#x200B;

Anyway, my dad said the girls in the office want me to come work again. I won't be doing all the different things I did before, though. I'd just be standing there scanning papers non stop for 8 hours a day. It's only for 3 weeks, so they aren't actually hiring me. Just want me to do the tedious work they don't have time to do. They aren't offering me a job, just some money to help out. I told my dad I don't want to do it. Maybe if it were one week, but I can't do that for 3. Especially because I'd have to get up at about 2:30 am to be there by 4:00 am. I told him that if they were to properly hire me, and have me do other things as well then I would do it, but I'm not going to stand there for 8 hours feeding papers through a machine. I have really bad back problems (scoliosis and an accident) plus the obvious boredom just isn't appealing in the slightest. 

He got kind of mad at me for not saying yes. Both because I ""should do it since I don't have a job"" and because they need the help. I know that I'm working toward things myself, and it's not my responsibility to help them but he has a way of making me feel guilty. My mom isn't really helping either, she keeps saying I should do it. I really don't understand why. If they were offering me an actual job and I wasn't taking it, I'd get it. But they aren't. It's just a few weeks.

My parents came home with tacos, and said my brother and I had to go get ourselves food but my brother didn't want to because he ate McDonalds with his friends. I felt pretty left out and my mom said she was going to get me a taco but my dad told her no and I could go get my own food with my brother. When my brother didn't want to, I decided to make my own dinner.

When he gave me the console he also gave me Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z (because we’re both total dorks) and GTA: San Andreas. Since then I’ve bought:
- GTA  IV
- The Last of Us
- Little Big Planet 2 (mostly for the nostalgia. It’s just such a genuinely good and wholesome game).
And 
- Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. I originally just planned on buying The Last of Us but Gamestop was having a 4 for $20 deal on used games so I got whatever they had that I was familiar with and liked. I love Call of Duty and definitely want to get my hands on MWII because that was one of my favorites when I was younger. So to give y’all a general idea of what I like: used to be OBSESSED with Halo reach when I was younger, too bad it’s only for XBOX. I also loved horror games, used to love watching my brother play Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2, when I was like 10 or 11 I was obsessed with Left 4 Dead. I also love just general adventure games, I’m a die hard Legend of Zelda fan (planning to get my hands on Majoras Mask for my 3ds). 

So yeah, I don’t know, just any suggestions would be great - new games or old. I haven’t gamed since middle school and now that I’m in college I’m super excited to get back into it all.

As someone who struggles with depression, this isn’t a foreign feeling. In fact I’m sure a lot of you know the feelings. It’s just frustrating because something usually sets me off, my
life is usually a mess, I’m fighting with friends, just some combo of things that makes me feel like life is pointless and meaningless and I should die.

But none of that’s happening right now. Everything’s fine. Not necessarily great but like it’s average. A normal fucking human being should be just feeling fine right now. But I literally want to die. I want to be dead. I don’t want to be alive. I don’t to wake up to see tomorrow. And the only reason I feel that way is because I start my period on Tuesday and my PMDD is a piece of shit that just wants me to take the fucking bridge I guess.

Its just awful you guys. I feel so helpless. I’m glad I can recognize it’s PMDD so I probably won’t kill myself since I know this feeling will go away in a couple days. If just sucks that I have to live these next few days in darkness and can’t do anything about it.

I am very much alive and I did not harm myself or attempt to. After making this post, I texted one of my closest friends about what I was feeling and she talked to me until I fell asleep.

There was nothing that set me off or triggered me, like today was just fine and average. One of my friends asked me to hangout before our class together and she and I had a good time. Like really today was fine, everything’s fine, but I can’t shake this emptiness I feel right now. I feel super alone and I feel like everyone hates me and I’m going to lose the people I love. It doesn’t make sense because like several people texted me today and saw me on campus and said hi or hugged me. I’m know I’m not alone, deep in my subconscious I know that to be true. I have friends and family who are there for me and I’m lucky to have that, but I still can’t shake this loneliness tonight. It’s like my head keeps telling me it’s not true and I’m alone.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if this is related to the Lexapro or not. Maybe it’s just a new thing that’s happening for no reason. But, considering it’s something that has never happened to me until upping my dose I’m going to consider that it might be a new side effect.

It started with just zoning out and feeling like I’m in a dream and nothing is real. Sometimes I feel like everything’s underwater, if that makes sense. It hits me out of nowhere, I can be taking a shower, walking to class, and all of the sudden its like I’m somewhere else.

Honestly the best way to describe it, for all you stranger things fans out there, it’s like I’m getting sucked into the upside down.

Tonight was the worst it’s been. I was with a friend and he was talking and he pointed out that I zoned out. I wasn’t zoned out, I simply wasn’t there. I wasn’t in the car with him and I couldn’t move. It wasn’t until he snapped me back into it that I realized where I was. Not too long after, we were walking across campus and I started seeing in third person. It was like I was someone else, a couple feet in front of us, watching us. Even right now I see myself sitting in bed typing this. The screen looks blurry and fake. I’m reading these words as I type them but my brain isn’t processing any of it. So, if there’s any typos or anything that doesn’t make sense - I apologize. Also, if I close my eyes it’s even worse, I can’t stop. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Nothing feels real. I’m not myself. 

I feel like people are getting frustrated with me for not paying attention and being “all there” but I don’t know what to do about it. I randomly snap into it and I don’t even know how to get out of it because this is all new to me and it’s never happened before.

I’m absolutely terrified and I just want this to stop.

I am sure people who struggle with self harm have been in the place I am right now.

This was the first time I ever really fought the temptation and didn’t give in. I’m using my coping mechanisms I learned and therapy and reaching out for help when I need it. 

And who knows, maybe I’ll relapse in a few days or a few weeks and have to start all over again. I hope that doesn’t happen, and if it does that’ll suck. But, this is a sign that I’m finally making progressing and taking a step forward in the right direction.

Last May when I was 19, I went in for my annual check up with my pcp. Just a typical check-up, got any vaccines and boosters needed, and we did our annual blood work just to make sure everything up to par as I’ve had issues with vitamin deficiencies in the past. I am a picky eater and also never really eat, partially bc of body dysmorphia and partially bc I just don’t prioritize eating. I also asked her to check my iron levels as I’ve been showing signs of anemia/iron deficiency for quite a while. 

A week later I get a call from her and she points out my iron levels are actually high, too high. My ferritin was at 220ng. I’ve read that up to 300 is a normal range but I’m quite a small person and also as a women my levels are expected to be lower because of menstruation. Cue an entire summer of blood work and tests, finding out I do carry the hemochromatosis gene, and the lowest we got my levels down to was 175ng, which was right after my period. I do have some of the symptoms of hemochromatosis especially that starting a few years ago I came down with horrible anxiety and a plethora of mental health problems. 

This is also concern because as I mentioned, I don’t eat. I was a vegetarian for a year, and I gave up red meat 3 years ago, I’ve very rarely eaten it since then, I can count on one hand how many times I eat red meat in a year. I also hate spinach and basically any iron rich food. I don’t take iron supplements, I am on Loestrin Fe and I know the inactive pills contain iron, but I never take the inactive pills, especially after that first
blood test. My doctor also said that’s not enough for my levels to be THIS high. I was concerned about anemia because the lack of nutrition in my diet, combined with very heavy periods I figured my body had no iron so to hear this was a shock.

I have been away at college and haven’t gone back for more tests and checks like I need to. I probably won’t go back until next month. So the question here is what do I do now? Even if I don’t have hemochromatosis and my body is just fucking weird and has a lot of iron for no reason, I feel like I should be careful. I know the risks of having excess iron and don’t want to end up dealing with it a couple decades down the road. I’m only 20 right now and I wanna get my health in check now because I know the older I get the harder it’ll be. I know that donating blood is a solution and I would love to do so, but I’m only 118 years old and horribly malnourished. I try to eat but I have really bad anxiety and depression, especially lately and eating impossible. I’m lucky if I have 1,000 calories in a day. I try, I really do but when you wanna die eating is the least of your concerns.

Is there anything I can do? I don’t eat foods high in heme iron. Should I get my blood checked again and talk to my doctor? I’m stressed about this. I wish I could just donate blood, and I mean I probably can but I don’t wanna risk passing out or getting sick. Any help or advice would be appreciated.

They flashed me a smile, while their arms were around their lovers waist, and they told me I was a great person with so much potential.

While every person I saw, from the checkout at the grocery store, to the old lady in the parking lot, looked at me with pity in their eyes.

And with a smile on their lips they told me it was okay if I wasn't okay, but I simply smiled and assured them that I was doing just fine.


But when I tell you I'm thinking of doing something new with my hair, what I meant was last night I held a pair of scissors to my head, wanting to chop off every strand. I thought that maybe if I didn’t look like myself anymore, I wouldn’t have to be myself anymore.

The other day I was hanging out with a friend of mine, I am going through a hard time and he reached out to me and has been trying to cheer me up. So, the other day I decided that instead of laying in bed and being depressed I’d go hangout with him and try and feel ok.

We went and got ice cream from a local ice cream shop, something we always do. Then we went back to my house to play video games. When we got there I immediately gestured to my bean bag on the floor and said “I cleaned everything off it so you can sit”. My room only has two places to sit - my bed or this beanbag - so I wanted to set a clear boundary by gesturing to the beanbag. He sat there and we played video games for a little while. At one point I sit at the edge of my bed and lean over to show him a video on my phone. Instead, he gets up and sits on my bed, uninvited. I brush it off and think “he just wants a better view of the video”. But, almost immediately he moves very close to me and positions himself in a way that I am literally cornered on the bed (my beds against a wall) . He the puts his arm around my waist and rests his hand on my lower hip/butt. At this point I’m like a little taken aback, so I try and shift away. He backs off for a second and then puts his arm around my waist again, this time with more grip and he rests his hand even lower on my hip. I froze, all I could think about is how I’m alone, in a room, on my bed with a man who could easily overpower me and is not taking a hint to back off. After a few seconds I get my shit together and immediately jump off the bed and make up some excuse for why he needs to leave.

He left, no problem. Tried to hug me goodbye, I gave him like a quick side hug and didn’t look him in the eye. After he left I cried. I could still feel his hand on me, so I took a shower. I talked to a friend of mine who knows him and he told me how my so-called “friend” has a reputation for being aggressive with women, not respecting boundaries, and not stopping until he gets what he wants.

Now all I can think about is what could have happened if I didn’t kick him out. He still tries to text me and lines all my tweets and every time I see his name on my phone I feel sick.

Basically, I suffer from depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. These were all diagnosed by a psychiatrist so yes my brain really just is a mess.

My depression has been up and down over the past few years, hell, I almost beat it this summer but sure enough it’s back and worse than ever. 

So where does my period come into play here? Well, my emotional PMS has always been bad. One of the first signs my period is coming is an anxiety flare up. I having panic attacks over anything and everything, I’m constantly in a state of panic in the days leading up to my cycle and the first few days. (Got my period last night, today has been a good day but I still feel extremely anxious, been shaking with anxiety all day). This has happened since my first period 7+ years ago. But, that’s not even the worst of it.

My anxiety and depression go hand in hand, I fully believe my depression feeds off my anxiety and would not exist - at least not to this degree - if it were not for my anxiety. So when my anxiety flares up, the thoughts in my head get worse and worse, they spiral out of control until they take a dark turn. I have suicidal thoughts every period. Last night I randomly and seriously thought about driving my car off the cliff I was driving past (didn’t do it because a friend was in the car with me), and sure enough as soon as I got home I got my period. Again, this happens EVERY MONTH.

It’s also come to my attention that since I’ve started struggling with self-harm, I can’t seem to get more than a month clean. You know when I relapse? On or immediately before my period. There’s only 2 times in the past six month I made it beyond a month - those 2 times are when I skipped my cycle.

I always - without fail have some kinda big breakdown usually the day before getting my period. It’s getting worse year after year, but something I’ve dealt with my whole life. It’s one thing to be a little anxious and over-emotional. It’s a whole other thing to spend all night crying so hard and shaking so badly with anxiety you nearly vomit, to self-harm and consider suicide. These all don’t completely go away after my period is over - obviously I’m still depressed but not like this. My self-harm urges and suicidal thoughts go away usually not to long once the period starts - for example I haven’t had any thoughts or urges of self harming since I relapsed Monday night (the day before my cycle started).

I take Loestrin, I’ve been on it for over a year it’s the only birth control that I’ve tried to work for me. I tried Ortho Tri-Cylcen Lo and Lo Loestrin but did not like either. I’m also in therapy and on antidepressants (Lexapro). So I’m TRYING everything and I want to get better. But it seems like every time I take a step forward my cycle comes and I take two steps back. Should I talk to my OBGYN? My therapist? Both? I just wanna get better, and I know my recovery isn’t 100% based on my PMS but if I can gain control over this it’s a HUGE jump and will really help my journey to recovering.

I’m a slave to my hormones, PMS is controlling so much of my life. Do any of you all with a uterus suffer through this absolutely destabilizing PMS, or am I just a freak of nature?

My side effects included:

-Muscle Spasms: Randomly and through out the day. They increased as the dosage increased. It varied from my legs, arms, shoulders, and even ear drum. 

-Grogginess: Although my thought was it was just the depression, my close friends and family said I was a Zombie. I did feel it; staring blankly, walking slowly, dull voice. I attributed it to the Abilify once I lowered the dose from 20 to 10 and it seemed to lighten up slightly. 

-Anxiety: Now I don’t know if this was attributed to the Abilify, or simply part of the depression. But I developed a strong anxiety while taking Abilify which went away as I decreased the dosage. I’m also using the Fisher Wallace Stimulator and started Effexor which could be why the anxiety decreased; but it was significant enough for me to mention it.

I don’t remember why we stopped. I feel like something may have happened that I am repressing? Maybe we were caught? This was also right around the time of my parents divorce, so maybe we stopped hanging out as much?

At some point, we went from being very friendly, to me not liking him. Idk what caused it. But I remember there was a point where we would fight a lot as kids after the fact.

Hi! I know a lot of those with BPD, including myself, struggle with believing that they can live a happy life because, as you know, it genuinely feels like pure hell on a daily basis. So, here is my success story to help give you hope & show you it is possible to live a happy & healthy life with BPD. Please try & read until the end and any support is appreciated; I am nervous about posting this. 

I was 13 when I got put on antidepressants and saw three counsellors for depression, up to the age of 16 where, at this age, I wasn’t eligible anymore. With no improvement appearing to have been made to my well-being, I was still severely depressed. During this time, though, more emotions started to come into play which were extreme. I was literally hysterical; my emotions were uncontrollable.

When I was 15 I started dating and oh my was it messy. I didn’t know boundaries, my emotions were all over the place, my rage was uncontrollable & well... you know how it goes & feels.

YET again I had a messy break up.  Heartbreak, rejection & guiltiness are the WORST emotions to process I swear. I didn’t know what to do with myself & I was now spiralling into worse episodes. I decided to stay single for the rest of my life because who would want me as me, right? Actually, why should I stay here for the rest of my life? 

I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt & seeing psychiatrists. New meds, changed meds, higher dosages, I was giving up. What was the point in fighting anymore? I was exhausted, no one would want me & all the abuse I’ve experienced in my life was going to control me forever. I felt like a puppet; my emotions, other people and abuse being strings which controlled my every move. 

I started reckless behaviours: binge drinking, smoking & self-sabotaging every relationship & opportunity I had. I had nothing to lose, right? 

Fast forward four years & I’ve nearly reached a year in a stable relationship with someone, who even discusses our future together! I got into one of the Top 15 Universities in the country (England) for Psychology with my A-levels and I volunteer as a Psychology (assistant) Lecturer teaching new A-level students the spec. so they don’t feel overwhelmed by content. I have even been able to hold down a full time job during my gap year to help students with learning difficulties (when before I used to have to resign because of how intense my emotions are & got threatened to be fired). I have stopped drinking alcohol & smoking because I know it is not good for me. 

I have episodes & I feel suicidal at times. One minute I’m soaring sky high, the next I’m depressed & then I’m raging. I can still go through what feels like 50 emotions at once. BUT I’m learning than that’s okay. My family ties are still toxic but I’m learning this situation is not permanent & I shall be flying the nest in September for Uni. 

So, here is some advice:

-take time to focus on YOURSELF before even considering a relationship. Attachment issues are one of my downfalls, but when I learnt to LOVE my own company and learnt to live WITHOUT somebody, the fear of someone leaving is far less of a threat.

-I have 3 workbooks I work through & read: ‘The Dialectal Behaviour Skills Workbook’ and another two under the same name but for anger & anxiety). You can get them off Amazon and can really help if you don’t have access to DBT therapy.

-Fun fact: it is NOT easy by any stretch, but you can gradually change your brain structures overtime. This means you can physically change how you see the world, how you feel emotions & how you react to situations, simply by consciously & actively changing your behaviours. Over three years, my experience has shown this is true & it is proven, so it does work! You can have control of your emotions, not the other way around.

-Define yourself as things other than BPD. I know it’s ironic, but don’t let a personality disorder define your personality. Focus on other attributes you have like. For example ‘I’m a (psychology) student’, ‘I’m a reader’, ‘I am a gymnast’. This will help you see yourself differently.

-It is not your job to be responsible for other people’s happiness. If they say hurtful things, this is a reflection on them not you. Learn to forgive yourself, too. It is okay to make mistakes, you’ll notice relationships can fix themselves & people will still love you even if you mess up. 

-When I feel intense emotions, I write them down in a notebook. This way I am not taking my emotions out on anyone & my episodes can remain private on a page. People need to respect your space when you ask for it, though. Finding coping strategies like this can help you manage those overwhelming feelings that are too intense to manage.

PLEASE PLEASE don’t give up hope and message me ANYTIME if you need someone. I hope this message has inspired you & has given you guidance so that you can beat BPD’s ass. It is possible to live a happy life where you’re in control.  You’re beautiful, INSIDE as well as out.
For those who’ve taken the time to read this, thank you - I hope it’s been worth it for you❤️

My life is one big waste. My brain is full of useless and obscure sports knowledge. I’ve dedicated my life to the athletes and obscurities that nobody cares about.

Because of this I have a limited skill set and almost no job experience. 

I’m stuck in a paradox where monotony keeps my anxiety down yet comfort brings me anxiety. 

I’m at a loss. I don’t want to disappoint my mom. She’s my rock and I’d sacrifice anything for her. Single mother with help from my grandparents growing up. 

I lost my job and need to pay rent until September. These next months will be hell. I have no idea what I’m doing.

Every day is depression and anxiety about the future and my situation. I only have moments of clear mind.

Started dating a girl last March. First several months were lovely. We both found ways to see each other while we were still in college, everything seemed right.

We get more comfortable, and then the last several months were pretty up and down. She’s a very type A personality and I’m on the autism spectrum. Highly functioning but still. I told her many times she was very dramatic and overbearing and she said she would try to change. 

I told her no don’t change your entire personality... just watch how you say things because you can be very obnoxious.

I felt like I was walking on eggshells with her. I have my own place and work full time and she graduates in December. I drive 45 min to see her basically every weekend and she’s still the same way, like girl I just want to relax on the weekends why is everything such a big deal?

All the little things added up. EARLIER in our relationship she would read my phone messages and then once I told her to stop, this guy through a mutual friend starts befriending her (okay whatever) and complimenting her behind my back. Through snapchat. I blew up and said how would you feel if this happened to me? She’s like oh it’s just a friend...

Well that was painful. She just loves the attention. She’s in a sorority and I couldn’t stand how annoying her friends were so yeah that’s relaxing. My ex (her) wasn’t as bad but you would see why she was in one if you met her.

So whatever I move on from that BS and it just turns into a general thing. She’s very over the top and just too much to handle. I don’t know what my future holds and she was deadset on a certain path so there was a disconnect.

The bigger picture is I just got tired of her antics and decided to end things. The good was great but it didn’t outweigh the arguments and bickering. 

She really is a great person and was a great girlfriend but she was just wayyyyyyyy too much for me. Way too much.


TLDR; struggling to come to grips with my last relationship. Little things added up and the more comfortable we felt, the more we got into it. Just didn’t seem compatible.

I have been feeling very down lately I moved two hours away from family to start a job that I ended up quitting because of my anxiety. My grandparents are close by but I hate asking people for help.

I miss my mom and siblings and friends and comfort of home but I know that I can’t use them as a safety blanket. I’m 23, I need to learn to live on my own. 

It makes it harder because while my girlfriend is very supportive, she’s a type A personality and there’s really no such thing as “relaxing”with her. 

She’s a supportive girlfriend and very loyal to me but she’s also very over the top and dramatic and obnoxious most of the time and it’s really annoying. I can’t imagine living with her in the future. I’d go absolutely insane.

Couple that with I don’t even know what my actual personality is so I’m just blending into whatever my surroundings are. I am myself around family but myself is more “autistic” than normal. 

I don’t even know who I am and what I’m doing in life or what I want. I am stuck at this job until at least September 30th because I have a lease to pay off. Biggest regret of my life.

I just have a lot going on and it’s so freaking hard trying to take care of everything I have. My car, apartment, bills, remembering to buy food for myself, etc.

Undiagnosed but sure I have Aspergers My entire life has been about following and watching my teams and scouting athletes, knowing random crap about the most obscure of people. I couldn’t tell you the 2014 AL MVP but I could match all of the backup catchers for that year in baseball and most if not all of their former teams. My recognition memory is off the charts. 

Anyways it’s not about that, it’s the fact that in high school I always felt more mature and enlightened than my peers and now it’s the total opposite. I feel like I’ve mentally regressed in terms of my outlook on life. I was so future and career oriented and now at 23 I feel 14 again. 

I have a job but there’s zero opportunity for growth. It pays fine for the short term but I am stuck in this position. 

Does anyone else find it hard to function day to day? I’m not even depressed I just find it hard to constantly be blending in socially and going into “modes” which impact other things. 

Example... I’m normally a very good driver but sometimes at work if I need to focus a little more then I can’t drive as well for a few minutes and then I’m okay. Everything in my life is about my brain adjusting to whatever I need to.

I can only be myself around family or really close friends. And “myself” is a highly reclusive introvert who loves nothing more than prefrontal cortex stimulation at the expense of social skills.

So all in all, I don’t even know what myself is. I don’t even think I have a personality. I have concrete interests but it’s a constant grind to fit in and act like I’m doing okay when in reality my NT friends are moving up in life when I will be stuck at the bottom.

I don’t know. I might go back to school for something computer related but I heard you need a background in that to flourish which I do not have.

We may not be compatible? So I’ve been dating her for a year now and I started dating her when I had major sleep issues so I kinda took the first girl that had interest in me because okay cool whatever. We met on a dating app and it’s always been long distance (45 minutes usually) and for the first few months it was awesome!

But as I’ve caught up on sleep I realize that she’s a very obnoxious and dramatic person. She’s a great girlfriend and means well with core values but we have different life plans ahead of us.

She wants to move to DC (USA) and work as a director somewhere while I want to remain close to home by my family in the northeast. I am highly functioning autistic so I need to further my seasonal special interests otherwise I go crazy.

She wasn’t like that to start and away from each other we seem fine but once I go to her house (which is every weekend) I feel like we always get into it. She’s a very stubborn person who comes off harshly and I’m laid back and just do my thing so when I’m around her I escalate into her and we get into it. I don’t feel like myself around her and feel very guarded because of her strong personality. She’s loud and dramatic and all that.

It’s an every weekend thing too. We never did this before and I’m wondering if it’s because she’s more comfortable around me or whatever it is.

But she’s the type of person that is so career and life oriented that you can’t even help her with anything because she has it “figured out.” Meanwhile she’s always on my case about what I do and it comes off as more of a mother thing than a girlfriend. We are supposed to co-exist and it doesn’t feel like we are compatible in the slightest anymore.

Is this all in my head? Maybe we just are a little too opposite for one another? Because nobody else says what she says I do (about being difficult or high maintenance) so I’m thinking it’s not me and it’s her.

I just need help explaining. Sorry if I left out details that’s really the gist of it. I feel this wall between us when I’m with her and while we’ve had some good moments I just don’t think we click. And I date for the long run so if she wants me to move with her or do this and that then I don’t know. I like being close to family and I just feel like I’m wasting my time.

And I’ve read articles affirming my incompatibility theory which probably doesn’t help but still. 

She’s a very dominant person and (this is gonna sound stupid but I’ll say it anyways) I feel a little powerless not being the primary support system. I as a guy feel like my girlfriend should always be able to come to me for help and she NEVER does that. She’s so independent and driven that she can do no wrong and it’s always me who needs improving. 

I grew up in a family where that was the case with men so excuse my traditional way of thinking but I truly enjoy being a means of support. And it goes both ways. 

Be honest with me please, am I being ridiculous or are we too different from each other? 

TL;DR: girlfriend and I were good to start but she’s a little too dominant and dramatic for me and it causes arguments on stupid things.

Yet, I get WARNED that a few more negative reviews and I am terminated.

Some days I can’t stand being alone while I’m in the library at school. The days where I can’t stand being alone, are the days where I have to hold in my tears because I’m so sad of it.

I’m only 18 and I’m realizing this issue. I probably won’t get much feedback or comments on this either because it seems most people on this sub are straight males but I don’t know where else to post. But, if you know any other better subs, please let me know. 
Okay, back to my issue. I’m a relatively decent looking male, I know I’m at least average. I am only into more straight male/masculine attributes, in contrast to the common androgynous gay male, or the really gay guy that expresses feminine attributes (and I mean this in the most inoffensive way). I am somewhat a shy guy and I would rather prefer if a gay guy went up to me instead of me going up to them. 

When I browse Grindr, I honestly can’t find a decent guy. I live in a relatively large town so it shouldn’t be my fault.

(My story) Since 12, I noticed symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder and general symptoms of depression. I knew what the word “depression” meant, but a very basic and not very knowledgeable meaning of it. I just thought it was being “very sad”. But then I realized depression is way more broad than that. Since I wasn’t so educated about depression, I guess you could say I gate-kept my symptoms as not being related to depression (ex. being tired all the time, losing interest in activities for no reason, etc). Because of this, I thought it was normal to feel this way and went without medication, therapy or any form of support for years. 

I then developed symptoms of social anxiety disorder at 12-13, which caused immense social impairment because I was too anxious to even look people in the eye when talking to them and dedicating myself to plans related to social situations. I did notice this wasn’t right to feel this because I didn’t feel like this before. The worst part is that I never got help for my issue due to mental illness stigma and my parents being against brain medications like SSRIs and benzodiazepines. This caused even more depression for me.

Also, I’m not saying that I am a psychiatrist or specialized doctor, but rather just well-informed and never have self-diagnosed myself, I just make assumptions until proven true.*

I typically am very educated in mental illness, considering that I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, OCD with impulsive thoughts and generalized anxiety disorder. I was diagnosed at 16 by a psychiatrist, and I already knew what I was going to be diagnosed with so I wasn’t surprised at all. But anyways, this was almost 2 years ago and I just have seen a new psychiatrist 1 week ago regarding diagnosis and treatment plans. 

To sum up the initial psychiatric session, we discussed the diagnosis part (as my psychiatrist only deals with diagnosis, not treatment plans). I elaborate on my presumed manic, hypomanic, depressive and mixed episodes I have. I explain the impulsive actions such as spending too much and on things you don’t necessarily need or want. The thing is, I don’t have much money at all so I used to buy junk food almost everyday until I ran out of cash and most times it was due to impulse and presumed hypomania, because I felt good in the moment. But the psychiatrist kinda gate-kept it as only spending your money on something worth more like gambling lots of money or buying a building or something like that. I also have engaged in dangerous behaviour such as drug use and binging on alcohol and have been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation/mental breakdowns due to my own request. I then explained my random euphoric/elevated energy and mood, combined with rapid speaking, decrease need in sleep and grandiose ideas that weren’t so “grandiose” but rather a sense of delusion in thinking that I am far superior than everyone else, and all of the other symptoms of hypo/mania. Sometimes my presumed mania can be triggered by poor sleep patterns, caffeine, doing something productive and high stress but sometimes it would come out of nowhere, especially when I’m suffering from loneliness. The psychiatrist said that mania or hypomania only occurs out of the blue and they can’t control it (which is so me!) but this is not true, as it can be triggered by things like caffeine or poor sleep. 

I tried to elaborate more on the symptoms I have been suffering from but the psychiatrist seemed very gate-kept in what is and what isn’t bipolar. For instance, I mentioned that I typically suffer from presumed hypomania (rarely mania) for 1-2 days, then followed by heavy depression symptoms for a week, then it cycles. She said that it has to be at least 4 days to be considered hypomania. She also mentioned my age (I am near 18) as a somewhat condescending way by say that I am “too young to be worrying about this” and shouldn’t focus on bipolar as it is a lifelong illness (which is true) and occurs in people typically around early twenties. My psychiatrist even showed me her DSM-5 book so I can read the requirements for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. At this point, I noticed that she was shutting me down, and that it would just become a back and fourth argument if I have bipolar disorder or not. After that, she just said that I still have major depressive disorder, and wouldn’t even diagnose me as having cyclothymic disorder as I don’t meet the requirements. After all of that, my appointment ended and I left her room very disappointed and shocked that I was fallacious.

Keep in mind I provided more details of my symptoms but didn’t mention them all in this text but rather mention the most important ones. Based on my experience with the psychiatrist, do you believe that I was right or wrong in this? And, does it even matter what the psychiatrist says when it comes to diagnosis?

I have been fat all my life (20M in uni) and what has been an obsession of mine since i realized it to please my sense of vanity, and to get validation from others. 
 I was at 245 lbs in may 2018. My self esteem has always been deeply flawed and weak, but dropping to 200 that mid august, i expected things to be fixed. 200 wasnt my goal, but i looked different. I gained some confidence, but it all spiraled down when i realized it didnt make as big as a difference as I wanted it to. In september i did self harm for my first and hopefully last time. 

Ever since then (and this has made things much worse the longer its gone on) my weight has stagnated, and its killing me. 

I was told this and i think its true: I have set lofty expectations for myself, and even if i met my goal of just being skinny and toned, i would not be satisfied. It would bring me satisfaction, but it would just make me even more upset that I can't get what i want, that body i want, but also validation and some sense of approval and 'you are doing the right stuff' from the people I want to hear it from.

I have it easy in many ways. I am a white guy with a supportive as fuck family, but I just always seem to never be satisfied.

For the past months (especially since March) having these thoughts in my head coupled with college being a fuckin upsetting ass  shitshow, has made me angry. I have heard this sentiment echoed by some of you, and having some more positive moments tend to make worse periods occur. Sorta the 'the sun is finally out it gives me hope' but there is the part of me where I know i could just go steep down any second. I can just get overwhelmingly defeated, or get so fucking pissed off at myself and the world. I want to just yell and scream sometimes but i dont do it. 

Being around people I want to physically be like and be acknowledged and approved from is a daily thing, and the constant absence of any proof of my obsession having a point and being treated the same just puts a bigger chip on my shoulder. There is a constant state of 'I will explode if i am around people right now' and a sadness that there isn't really anyone consistently there for me that is my age.


This is just a perpetual cycle. I want to just be perfect, to be validated. I am wasting my time thinking of it when my loved ones won't be around forever, but i still feel it. I still am almost always upset with myself and the world, and I refuse to accept with who i am. There is so much of me i can step back and say 'damn he is a cool
 dude' but there is so much crucial stuff that i constantly weigh how much i truly hate myself.
 

This vain obsession has been with me always, even if i didnt really know about it. I have always been like this. Like I said before, i dont think I can ever get what i want, and it pisses me off that its like this.

Since I can remember (weight is a touchy subject as everyone has different experiences with it), I have been at 200 or above, with pretty much every year in high school being 240s ish. Finally hitting 200 in August 2018 just didn't make me feel accomplished.

I had built up losing weight for sooooo fucking long (because my problem at my core is how vain i am) that I expected it to magically wipe away all my problems. I'd finally get attention from women, id finally just be content.

It didn't do that. Shortly into that semester (august 2018) After overblowing a seemingly trivial (but damn important to me) fuck up, I went into a week in a half period of a depressive episode, nothing like I had ever experienced before. I have been seeing someone and taking meds since 2015, and there was nothing like it. I tried cutting, but it didn't work out and I just didn't wanna do it. I ended up not eating, and just having bouts of crying and a whole lot of hysteria.

It is so hard to describe, but there was a definite before and after. It started a new chapter in my life. Before I always had some dumb fuzzy idea I was curable, but after, I realized that this thing i have, depression and anxiety, could only be coped with and treated. No cures.

Coincidentally, ever since then, my weight has stalled (I want to get t o 170). I think its partly psychological.

  
Thinking of it now, I am in a near constant need of validation. I NEED to be told or given some sign that I am doing what is right to get to my goals, and i just dont have it. The only thing that takes that feeling away is weed.

In college I developed moderate levels of anxiety. I was interested in med school but decided that due to the stress I faced in college that PA school would be the better option. PA school is far less expensive and debt was one of my biggest concerns. I lived at home for two years following college which I used to work and save up money while applying to Pa school. At my parents request I also agreed to apply to med school although I had no intention of enrolling. I was confident that PA school was the correct decision. My dad was furious about this and my mom was also unhappy with my decision. My dad would regularly put me down about being an idiot for choosing PA school. At times it seemed like he was turning a corner to be more supportive but then as soon as he heard about another one of our relatives kids going to med school he would freak out again.

I was accepted to both Pa school and med school. I had the intention of going to PA school but two months before PA school was to start I had a change of heart. I think this was due to the fact that I saw my cousins going to med school, my anxiety was reduced since I had been out of school for a bit, and my parents really wanted me to go to med school. They were also willing to provide significant financial support in med school. 

Fast forward to now and I just left medical school during second year. I dealt with a lot of anxiety in med school which became unbearable second year. I spoke with a school therapist and admin and just realized that this could get a lot worse if I continued. I was also very afraid of wasting more money. My intention was to pay my parents back but now I’m working a job making like 13/hr. I’m very angry with my parents for forcing me to apply to med school.

I asked him if he would do a leak test prior to installing but he said that after the unit is installed is when he would check all of that.

So the insurance company determined that my parent's non\-working ac (\~25 years old) should be replaced and the furnace should also be replaced. They also said there was a leak somewhere in the system. These are the estimates I have so far:

1. Company 1 is a local hvac guy. He quoted me $7,700 for a 1 stage Trane a/c, furnace, and humidifier. He can also do ""ICP"" brand for $6,700. This guy made a big deal about getting an ""18in box"" which I think will be used to lift the furnace. Company 2 said they'd do a 10in box, but this guy said it needs to be 18in for some reason. Currently there is no box and the furnace sits on the ground. He also said getting a 1 stage unit is a good idea and that 2 stage isn't worth the money. He also said that the brand company 2 is offering (Lennox) needs special technicians and therefore is not a good idea.
2. Company 2 is also a local HVAC guy. He quoted $7275 for a Lennox ""80&#37; 2 stage furnace 110k BTU and 13 SEER 4 ton condensor with matching cased evaporator coil and healthy climate power humidifier"". He said he would tie this into existing freon lines, gas, electric, plumbing, chimney and duct work. I think company 1 said that he would do new lines and he said that was very important. Company 2 said that the ""insurance meant that there was a leak somewhere in the system, but that is rarely in the lines"" so its fine to use the existing lines.

If I watch it at 1x speed it will take 60 mins. If I watch it at 2x speed it will take half the time (30 mins). So I thought that if I watch it at 1.5x speed then I am watching it at the speed that is exactly in between 1x (aka normal speed) and 2x. So therefore it should take me 45mins. Why isn't it 45?

I've been on this road for almost a year now. Seen my family doctor upwards of 10 times. Two different counselors. Two psychiatrists. On two different medications.

The second psychiatrist I just saw today. Was referred when I brought myself to the ER one night because I didn't know what else to do. Was told it was for ""diagnostic clarification"". God, that sounded so good to me. Yeah, I'm on medication but almost a year later and no one has said to me ""you have X."" 

I know, I know, a diagnosis can be sketchy. There's overlap. I get it. But nobody's even narrowed anything down. Literally everything in the book has been floated around. Depression, anxiety (which I remember learning in psychology were the opposites of each other???), OCD, bipolar, personality disorders, mild autism. The list goes on. 

I can cope anymore. It's ruined my life. My friends are currently not speaking to me because they feel overwhelmed. I wish I didn't have to talk to myself; I feel overwhelmed. I want a diagnosis of something.

An appointment today. I was so hopeful. I was in for a total of 10 minutes. She told me to increase my medication...a road I was already on. That's it. I said, ""I was told this was for diagnostic clarification."" Her response, ""well I don't know you well enough."" Adjust the medication. Keep seeing your counselor.

What the fuck??? I'm so disappointed. I feel like I was rushed out, because as soon as I got out, she took in this elderly couple who was waiting there since before she took me in. And she had said to them then, ""oh sorry, I'm running behind.""

I feel so lost in this system. Everyone expects me to take some pills and get better. Hell, some people think I don't even need the pills...just stop being so anxious and suicidal. The doctors' solution is just see the counselor and they'll fix you. I don't even know what I'm dealing with! After a goddamn year.

It's a trap. I've come to know this can't be trusted. You'd think i was fine from that first paragraph. I'm 15 minutes removed however from accosting my friend at work because he wouldn't respond to my texts any longer. The other two have also stopped responding and removed themselves from our group chat. One blocked me altogether.

I'm sick, twisted, unstable, and manipulative. My illness has sent me down a dark hole. I simply cannot go on like this. But what do I do?

I have a whole week of work ahead of me starting tomorrow. Training just ended, this is the real deal now. But I can't even think about work right now. My life is a bottomless pit.

I'm calm right now, I'm breathing steady. I almost feel at peace.

Last night I was on the verge of suicide for the second night in a row. My friends who have stated numerous times that they are overwhelmed, did not answer last night. The night before, they were on a group call keeping me alive for an hour.

This morning I wake up to being blocked, not having a group chat, and my friend ignoring me at work with the most miserable look on his face when he saw me. 

I want people to smile when they see me. I simply feel disgusted with myself. I make everything worse. The crisis worker I last spoke to said it's not me however, it's my illness. I don't know if I believe that. It certainly doesn't help. My friends no longer respond to me or my illness.

I literally feel nice right now with a subtle breeze against my face. I feel like in the moment everything else is fake and a nightmare and life isn't so bad. I'm the person I want to be for a few seconds. But it's farthest from the truth. I no longer know how to carry myself.

I've sent upwards of 100 messages in the last 24 hours. With not one response. The more time without a response, the more I send. Growing more and more anxious and off the rails. 

I can't live like this. In about 5 minutes I'm sure I'll stop feeling the breeze and do something impulsive and essentially psychotic. 

The breeze tricks me. I'm not as okay as it makes me feel. I've actually never been this broken before. I need help but my life won't stop. I'm sitting on a stoop.

It's so hard for to get people to understand what goes on in your head. Dumb thoughts that linger all day long. I have many personal issues that I am dealing with - I won't get into them. Everybody's situation is different, but I'm sure most people here can relate to having to deal with *something* at all times. You feel better about one thing...something else makes you feel worse. You see one ounce of self-improvement...some thought enters your mind and you just go back to hating and doubting yourself. You climb one mountain...there's a bigger one on the other side.

I've been going through an increasingly harder time lately dealing with almost constant anxiety and depression, waiting and waiting for appointments that are still coming up, trying to get the proper help for myself. But the waiting is taking a toll. I'm the kind of person that needs to have a bunch of things planned out to be able to look forward to something otherwise I feel like I don't even have a reason to get up some days (effin' depression). I can't just sit at home almost every night with no plans, it's making me go crazy. 

This concert is something I've had in my mind for a while, and I just assumed I would find someone to go with. But now I have no one. So...I'm debating whether I should go alone. Pros: it would give me a night out, it is something I've been looking forward to and can still look forward to up until the night comes, and I will really enjoy the music. It sounds like a good idea until my anxious brain starts coming up with thoughts like these:

- I'm a gigantic loser who doesn't know enough people to find someone to go with (I mean c'mon, it's a pop concert!)

- I'm gonna be some creepy weird loner at a concert sitting/standing beside all these people who came in groups, feeling self-conscious.

- Everyone around me is gonna be looking at me weirdly after they realize I'm there alone since I'm not talking to anyone

- Worse, some random (probably inebriated) extrovert sitting next to me is gonna realize I'm alone and start talking to me trying to befriend me (cue social anxiety)

- I will spend the entire concert feeling uncomfortable, unable to freely dance/jump/sing along/have any fun whatsoever because I have no one there to enjoy the music with 

- Lastly, I'm a loser, I'm a loser, I'm a loser!

I'm probably overreacting but this is giving me major anxiety nonetheless. How can I possibly go and enjoy this by myself? Has anyone done this before? Has anyone done this before and actually lived through it lol? Any 'success' stories/tips? Are my trepidations unwarranted? I hate how everything I wanna do is completely marred by my anxiety, something a lot of you guys and gals can relate to.

TL;DR: The thought of going to a concert alone gets me incredibly anxious, but I'd really like to go to one in particular. Tell me what it was like when you went to a concert or some other large festival/gathering by yourself. What tips would you give me from one anxious person to another?

I've recently reached out to three close friends, my only friends, about my social anxiety. (Been dealing with it for years, progressively gotten worse, more and more isolated, but finally getting professional help. Hopefully this is the beginning of the road to recovery.) They've each been super supportive. One of them has had a little more trouble understanding my anxiety and what he should do to help, but I get it. It's hard to know how to deal with this and what to say when you've never had to think about it before. 

Even with their support, I still find it impossible not to feel like MAJOR burden on them!

Just talking about my issues and trying to get them to understand a little more actually helps me out a lot and puts me at ease simply because it feels good to finally get it all off my chest. But I can't even imagine how depressing these conversations are for them. I don't steer the conversation there ALL the time and honestly the occasional distraction is sometimes just as good as talking about it. But now it's like ""a thing"" so it's hard not to address it because they're obviously thinking about it whenever they see me given how fresh this all is. Point is, we end up talking about it a lot. In person and over text. I worry it's too much and they get annoyed by it. That I want to talk about it way more than they do. Sometimes I swear they're so annoyed. Maybe it's in my head though because that's what I expect? But I mean how can they not be.

Even still, they tell me I'm not a burden. They've said it to my face. But I just don't believe them. I can't help but think that that's just what you say to a person in my situation. 

The three of them are actually out tonight at a little gathering. I was invited but couldn't go. Didn't know most of the people anyways which would have given me anxiety lol. But now here I am sitting and obsessing over all the fun they must be having without me there to bring the mood down. They must be having such a good time without me. The conversations I have with them must be so draining for them. I just can't stop obsessing over being such a burden.

I've recently admitted to myself that I have serious anxiety problems and I've had them for a while now. Serious enough that I finally realize I need professional help which is a good step I know. Looking back, I've always had these issues (I saw a psychologist as a kid briefly) but they haven't really dominated every aspect of my life like I've let them over the last 4 years or so. I'm in my early 20s now and it's finally pretty clear to me that every major life decision I've made over that time period has been ruled by my anxiety. I've avoided new relationships whether that's making friends or dating because I hate having to meet and talk to new people. I've basically changed the course of my schooling and decided against doing what I went to university for because it would have brought me too much anxiety to approach people for say summer work related to my program or working on a thesis. 

The only friends I have are from high school. I'm really good friends with them and it's good to have that support (I've had 1 on 1 conversations with a couple of them about these problems, doing it all in a group seemed overwhelming) but I realize that it's normal to also start new relationships too. It's something I haven't been able to do because of my anxiety. It is something my friends have been able to do however. And even though I know it's wrong, that makes me super jealous and it feels like I can't help it. It's not simply about me being jealous because I want their attention and don't want others to have it, but more so because I'm jealous that they basically have the social skills and confidence to forge new friendships while I don't. I know that this should be a natural part of life.

I'm pretty certain it's social anxiety disorder (every symptom I read about seems to match) along with bits and pieces of a few other anxiety disorders. I'm sure that will clear up as I move along in the process of getting help. If I get that far. 

I have an appointment lined up in the next week with my doctor where I'm gonna bring this up (which will probably give me anxiety itself) and hopefully get a referral. There are no sooner appointments, I've already been waiting for like a week and a half. But just knowing that all of this is coming up and I'm going to have to start dealing with it head on is soooo overwhelming. Lately I've been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep because I keep thinking about starting this process along with everything else that already gives me anxiety. I feel like my appetite has decreased. I'm nauseous at random points throughout the day. More problems than usual. All because, I think, this is now coming to a head. It's like the culmination of years of my anxiety reaching this critical point where it can either make me or break me. That's what it feels like anyways. So...is this a common reaction to seeking out help? Has anyone else dealt with this? Did it get worse and worse up until the day finally came? Did it get better as the process began? It's the unknown that comes along with this process that gives me more anxiety. What kind of sick joke is that universe lol!!

First: i gained weight... shouldn't be too surprising.

Anyways. The first time i inserted it it was lunch time. I felt sick in the evening and in the middle.of the night, after not even 12 h, i got up and vomited for solid 5 minutes. Since i didnt think of the ring i didnt take it out immediately so i vomited two more times.

After a few days i called my doctor. She told me that she never had those side effects, especially after such a short time and asked if i could.have eaten something that could.have caused it. I had sushi so i blamed that and tried again.

When i got home i inserted it again, this time in the evening. And it worked like a charm... besides making me look like a whale who eats 1k cal per day but still gains... im so sick of this btw. I also experienced something weird... it makes me a morning person. I had sleep issues my ENTIRE life but with the ring i felt fresh and awake in the morning.

I kept it in a small plastic bag and asked her about the effects. She said that after only 16h some side effects can show but usually not that massive - especially since theres not enough hormones in the body yet to even make a big change, especially since the side effects were 100% vomiting, no nauseousness, headaches etc.

So we agreed to try it again and i inserted it at ~7pm in the evening i think.

I immediately removed it and put it aside (i left it outside of the plastic bag, i was busy vomiting...). 

Now i wonder... could it be the time? I asked her specifically when side effects usually start and she said since its not a pill that gives you the max amount immediately it shouldn't start before a few days after inserting it - min of what she ever heard of 2 days.

If it was placebo, could it make me vomit bc of that? Is that possible?

What happens if someone comes and tries to wake you up? Will you be torn back into your body? Will you even realize? 

Many said they can project while still being in the ""real"" world, does what you see resemble reality? Like is it possible for a friend to write something on a piece of paper in another room and you watching and knowing what they wrote without even physically being there?

If you can be in the ""real"" world, can you interact with things? Can you ... idk walk through people like a ghost? If not, does the floor, for example the carpet, show footsteps in your perception while it doesnt for others (i mean... i never saw a random footstep so...)

I am just very interested in the whole thing although i have to say that i never successfully attempted to project... im sorry if some questions are silly or just weird...

I  just moved into a new apartment and the neighbour has a newborn. Theres  lots of crying and so on but its really muffled through the walls most  of the time, only when they are at their entrance I can hear it really  well. Im not complaining, its a child, they just cry and its not like  its a big issue.

But  while i listened to them walking outside the door with the child  screeming bloody murder I realized something: the cries seem so...  unhuman to me? Im a VERY sensitive person and when someone is crying or  screeming or is just angry i get super stressed out and am anxious  myself but with this baby - nope, nothing. Its just a noise in the  background for me, nothing that i connect to someone needing help or to a  human being that screems in pain or want for attention.

Ive  had lots of people telling me that ""as a woman a baby crying must be  really stressful to you, its nature!"" and ""that i just act to prove a  point, women's ears are made for cries of a baby"" or ""Its diiiifferent  when its you ooown"" (Are you sure because you yourself DO feel concerned  about crying babies without it being yours....) and so on... yeah its  true that women hear higher sounds in general and wake up to higher  sounds quicker but at least for me thats already it.

So  the baby went on crying and it wasnt really bothering me, I didnt even  feel the need to make it stop. My door is REALLY thin and it felt like  it was crying in another room with the door open but if this was my  child it wouldnt have crossed my mind to check on them.  My washing  machine in the bathroom thats going crazy right now is more annoying and  i would be more concerned about my washing machine making screeching  noises than a baby....

Idk  if im just a bad person but that ""instinct"" to help those who are  crying which i have for literally everyone just isnt there for children  and babies.

It triggered a dissociative state and didnt respond while crying and hyperventilating and i had a few minutes of complete memory loss. But I just remembered what ACTUALLY happened.

*tldr:* I didnt sleep for half a year because of panic attacks. Then my body tried to get every second of sleep it could get to compensate, up to 13h a day. My therapist and my best friend searched for an evening routine to sleep earlier and after i explained why the mentioned things arent working for me i was called uncooperative and lazy.

So, *background*: as i said i didnt sleep for a long time bc i had panic attacks in the night. Then when i could sleep again my body demanded up to THIRTEEN hours of sleep per night and completely paralyzed me in the morning, no joke i was PARALYZED. I couldnt even raise my hand to turn off the clock. Also keep in mind: i took doxepin, a sleep inducing pill. That also played its role....

So in one of the sessions i brought my best friend with me and we talked about my sleep. In the evening i could not go to bed, i am simply a night owl and i will not sleep at 9 o clock. We then talked about evening routines to ""get me to sleeping earlier"".

- The first thing was ""shut the lights"". I explained that i had night mode on all devices with extremely red light and that i used only an ikea light string as a lamp.

- sports: i visited the gym twice a week

- walking: i have two dogs, you bet your ass i am walking

- a bath routine: i have acne, my skin treatment i do every single evening takes 15 minutes. So yeah, if that aint a routine i dont know either.

- meditation: tried it, hated it. It makes me feel itchy and nervous.

- reading: i dont like reading a lot but usually i either dont read at all or binge the whole book in one night. Not how things should go...

- puzzle alarm: I CANT MOVE MY HAND TO SWITCH IT OFF HOW SHOULD I SOLVE A PUZZLE

- making the house ready by closing all blinds, shutting the lights etc: i have one single.room... that is 2 seconds. And who sleeps with their lights on???

- opening the curtains so the sun comes in in the mornings: they are ALWAYS open while i sleep otherwhise i feel trapped

- showering in the evening: my mom sleeps very early and her room is above the bathroom, she will kill me.if i do

Basically at that point everyone kind of realized that its not THAT easy to be a hardcore night owl with sleep issues in a disgusting early bird society and they got angry. So my therapist started: ""now listen OP, it is either ""i do this, i cant, this wont work"" for any suggestion - dont you think you arent cooperating enough?"" And my friend went on ""Oh its just OP doesnt want to leave their phone..."" and then both looked at me being like: ""so, now, tell us a time when you will sleep and then you will at this time! Nonono,.no buts tell us a time!""

.... excuse me but show me where i DIDNT explain why things arent working the way you think? Also, my phone keeps me calm. I have social anxiety and it is the only place where i can talk to people without being anxious. It feels like a hearing aid for those who are deaf to me. Yes, my phone is important to me. Also both my friend and therapist said they like watching tv in the evening. Where is the difference??? Also, my phone keeps my mind from racing in circles which makes me really really anxious sometimes because if my mind starts racing once i wont calm down anytime.soon.

I didnt know what to say, i already started to enter dissociation and my mind just started spinning and i didnt know what i was thinking anymore. So i said anything.that came to my mind and was a number or time. I think i said ""seven"", i honestly didnt even know anymore what time ""seven "" in the day even was and wondered for quite some time if that was before or after i came home from uni or some shit like that. My therapist said ""oh thats a bit early, make it nine that is all right"". At this point my friend might have noticed that they were going too far and asked if we shouldnt start slow.

But in the end they just kept talking how i need to step outside of my bubble or something and how i need to do idk what, but i now remember that i just put my head down in this moment and everything turned black, i still cant remember what happened after this but i ""woke up"" sitting in the same spot hyperventilating and not knowing what happened for the last 20 minutes. 

I came there for HELP, not to be looked down upon and laughed at. I felt safe at my therapists office and i felt safe with my friend but that was the only thing they thought and probably still do, that i am lazy and uncooperative, that i just dont want to sleep so i pretend i am sick. 

I dont know why i remembered all of this NOW... but i do. I feel really betrayed. I dont know why these few comments were so hard for me either.

Parents are so quick at whining how hard they have it and how much of a struggle life is. Im sorry, but i am not sorry in the slightest. Is almost as if the world would show them what they put their child up for.

One of the most ridiculous things is how women call themselves ""oppressed"" after having a child. How they claim they shouldn't have to choose between ""a child and a career"". Like - excuse me? Not only did you bring a child here into all the pain of this world, now you also want it to only be a toy somewhere additional to your perfect life with a glorious career? That is total bullshit. Fathers are even worse - i get that someone needs to earn money but i dont understand how you just casually have a child while fighting to have even more income or an even better position in your job. You created a human for fucks sake, now at least take care of it yourself. Also that ""my pregnancy put me back a few months in my career that is sexist"". Oh i am sorry did creating a human you didnt ask for consent YOU wanted to selfishly breed so you can have your genetic mini me influence your life? Must be hard!

And the ""i am tired because my baby cried the whole night"" thing - yes babies cry - when their stomach hurts. When they are scared. When they are sick. When they are too hot/cold/hurt themselves etc. All of this is nowhere pleasant but dear mommy or daddy lack sleep! Compare the amount of times you heard ""they scream the entire night, its so frustrating"" to ""their stomach hurts a lot so poor thing cries long times during the night"". Parents dont care. They want their doll but please without effort or without influences in their daily life.

I feel so sorry for children. Whenever i see a child i dont feel ""joy"" or shit like that. I see a poor soul that will slowly but surely have to face what the world really looks like. I am highly introverted like many children are and i was in kindergarten for ~4h per day and I already dreaded that. Whenever i had to stay longer i became highly aggressive.

There are so many children on this planet in need for a home. We should help all of them! We should give them a family. 

There are many ways to do so. Often homosexuals are said to do so, or those who are infertile. But why on earth not also those women who dread, dislike or fear pregnancy/birth? 

Generally a phobia is nothing you HAVE to overcome. Often you only need to learn how to deal with it in a way to live your life regularly. You arent ""weak"" or sick for having a phobia. You dont have to be ""healed"". You just need to sort it out - be it by leaving the fear behind, avoiding triggers or changing your live so it isnt an issue.

So why on fucking earth do i hear EVERY SINGLE TIME i read about tokophobia that women should be in therapy and ""recieve the help they can get to *enjoy pregnancy and birth like normal*""

Just make it clear that those who still want a child can also adopt. That they dont necessarily have to be pregnant to have and raise a child. I dont get it... It would improve so many lives of numerous children...

The truth probably is that no matter the conveniences - less orphans, women/families (yes, also men can be tokophobic when it comes to their partner) - popping out children is the only goal we are supposed to have. We arent supposed to decide it, be it being childfree or adopting. People dont want us to decide. They want to force us to live how they live.

She laughed at me and threw every bingo at me she possibly could. Back then i knew a child would grow in you but i had no idea how it worked. I was born through c-section and to me it was the normal way to have a child. I knew there was a natural way but i wasnt interested.

My sister was born through csection as well. When the surgery was scheduled i stayed over at my grandparents place and we knew the exact time for the surgery. We waited on the phone for 15 minutes until my dad called and told us i now have a sister. To me that was childbirth. I hadnt experienced anything else. I didnt know of anything else.

But i still didnt want children. I had a doll and a crib but i rarely played with it. I much rather put my dog plushies in and pretended i would be the ""dog mom"". I then got an extremely large dog plushy from relatives and then i would pretend to be the owner of a dog family while my large dog had babies. 

But it was never ME who i thought would have and raise the child. It was beyond me why i would ever want to raise one. It felt so weird and wrong my entire life...

I didnt know how sick pregnancy makes you. I didnt know how you have to basically wear diapers sometimes otherwhise you would pee yourself. I didnt know how your boobs would get sore, how your skin would be stretched and your boobs become saggy. I didnt know how hard moving must be with a baby in you, i didnt know how much the back can hurt from the weight. I didnt know that it can hurt when the baby kicks you from the inside. I didnt know the agony of childbirth, i didnt know that it would take HOURS before the child even moves while you try to breath in constant pain with your SO and a bunch of doctors staring at your pussy. I didnt know much it hurts to have your cervix stretched, how you can tear your vagina open from ass to clitoris, how the husband stitch will make any sexual activity painful afterwards. I didnt know any long term effects from childbirth, how it will ruin your body, how it will destroy your relationships, your hobbies and your dreams...

When i found out slowly my only ever thought was ""why the fuck would anyone do that"". Not only for women - also men. I am lesbian so i didnt have to be pregnant myself but imagining seeing my girlfriend or wife going through all of this, having to sit next to her in the delivery room while she turns mad from the pain and i cant help her is stressing me out as well.

One example are sports and games. No matter what game or sport it is, I have awful reflexes, reaction speed, low physical strength, and I'm not that clever. Another example are my club leadership positions: I'm just mediocre, and I feel like I'm the clueless one who's dragging everyone down.

I've never had a relationship before and I'm 21. I have a crush right now (although I feel attracted towards other girls too). It feels awful because I have no idea how to get closer (either as a friend or something more intimate). 

Many of these attractive girls that I crush on have their close friend groups/cliques. Although I'm in the same college club organization, I still find it hard to get close to anyone. And then even if I get close, I feel like I'm too unattractive and flawed to be worthy. I put girls on a pedestal, and I fear getting to close because I don't want to come off as a creep. I care a lot about being respectful and considerate, but that's not enough.

As a note, I'm trying to avoid the nice guy archetype. It's just everything around me feels like it's pushing me towards that. I'm nice, but that's all I have going for me.

To start off, I'm an introverted 21 year old in college and I've never had a relationship. Lately I've been feeling envious of others who are in relationships (in a comparison to myself way). I don't mean harm towards others, but I lack self-esteem and a lot of other factors like being physically attractive, being interesting, outgoing, having a funny/cool/reliable personality, etc. Throw in depression, self-hatred, guilt and it's clear I'm not a stable person.

There's several problems with the crush. 

1. She's out of my league. She's much more physically attractive than I am, and my lack of confidence, personality and other traits doesn't redeem anything. 

2. We're friends, but not close or anything. I have a hard time getting close to anyone because of how awkward, shy and boring I am. I also don't share her favorite interests to the same level.

2. It's not really a ""best friend"", but if you're familiar with a big-little system in college club organizations (like a mentor/sibling relationship) it's that. They get along like best friends and share the same interests. The crush is the little, and the big is protective of her. I've heard him say before ""no guys allowed"" (in a dating context) because they all just want to get in her pants (I doubt he's joking). The big is also my friend so I don't want to get on his bad side.

Now here's the problem. Obviously, I feel physically attracted to her because I don't know her that well as a person. Which makes me unsettled because I feel like a monster for proving the in-the-pants thing true? 

Even though I'm attracted to her, I think what I'm really looking for is someone I can be intimate with and lower my guard. But that means I have to get closer, which is hard for someone awkward like me. 

I don't think I should confess yet (I should get to know her better and open up more). However, if I do ever try to confess, how do I deal with this dilemma? I want to be respectful, considerate and not bothersome. I'm ok with being rejected as a friend, but I fear being rejected like a creepy plague to avoid-at-all-costs (it'd make me feel even more like a monster).

Problem is, many of these girls are already in relationships. And it spurs a painful feeling of envy when my friends and peers around me are in relationships. I've never had a relationship before either. 

I'm very introverted and [Kurtzgesagt's video on Loneliness](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA) has a great metaphor: I don a suit of armor to protect myself, but it makes me closed off too. 

I'm not physically attractive, and my personality isn't anything special either. I'm quiet, unassuming, socially awkward and lack self confidence. Throw in depression and a great amount of self-hatred (I really don't respect myself) and it's a recipe for disaster. 

Just to note, I don't want to fall down a path of being like a nice guy, incel, or some other monster that objectifies women as an achievement. But it's not a good thing either to put women on a pedalstal. 

It's clear I should be focusing on self improvement and self compassion instead of chasing after relationships when I'm broken to begin with. Most people say something cheesy like I need to love myself before I can love others. I feel like it's the opposite though, I'd want to be able to love someone else to feel more complete and accept myself. 

And if I'm not ready now when I'm 21 in college, when will I be ready? Given everything about me, it's more likely I will stay alone than find someone who will love me back.

Envy: a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.

I'm envious of friends who are more social and outgoing than me.

I'm envious of others who are in relationships.

I'm envious of those who are in majors/careers they are passionate/skilled in.

I'm envious of peers in leadership positions who have superior work ethic, ideas, creativity, articulation, confidence and are still accomplishing more than I am. 

I'm envious of those with qualities that I lack. 

I do feel like a perfectionist, which is bad when I don't have the ability to back that up and no self-compassion to forgive and move on. I fixate on how flawed and incomplete I am, and envy how the grass is greener on the other side. It might be better if I stop comparing and just be the best me, but I'm not even good at typical INTP strengths. There are plenty of other non-INTP who can analyze and deconstruct far better than I can.

I know the rules say no ""diagnosing"", and I know people will suggest talking to a mental health professional. But it's not always an easy thing to do, and the waiting times could be months and months (I have tried before so I know).

So please don't worry about ""diagnosing"", I know to take opinions here as opinions and not an absolute fact, and I'd also appreciate if you guys can provide sources/info that can shed some more light. I guess I'm trying to find out what potential problems *might* cause these symptoms, as well as if there are names for the things I'm describing so it's easier to talk about in the future. 

OK, so my situation: Last June, I became severely depressed after coming to realize the world is completely different from how I thought it was.

I went to see doctors, I read self-help books like Feeling Good, and I feel like I've gotten a lot better at managing; I don't take meds and didn't feel the need to (I'm not against taking meds though).

I've become a lot more mature over the past year, gained a lot of perspective, and started fixing a lot of my personal problems. I started swimming again after no exercise for over 10 years, and I swim pretty much every single day.

But for the past little while, something started happening.

At first, it was quite rare, I would feel a little ""jolt"" of shock going through my brain while I am trying to sleep, and then my body would uncontrollably twitch, I'd wake up, and then it'd happen again. But that's it.

Recently, it's gotten worse. The past couple of days, every time I try to sleep, I end up with mini dreams about 30 minutes in length, and every one of these dreams are super super depressing.

It's not the content of the dreams themselves that is depressing; but somehow my entire mindset becomes extremely bad. Like normally, even if I feel depressed, even if I feel anxious, there are things I look forward to like finding a girlfriend, starting a family of my own, travelling the world, eating delicious food...

But when I'm in that half-asleep depressive state, NOTHING feels desirable/motivating. Life literally just feels like a huge pain and annoyance. While not to the point of being suicidal, it does make me feel liek why am I even alive.

Plus, I still get those ""jolts"" and also I don't know if it's adrenaline or what, but feels like some chemicals squirt out from my heart into the rest of my body. Very uncomfortable. And then I wake up, and when I try to fall asleep again, the same thing happens again.

Is my depression getting worse? Am I developing other problems like bi-polar disorder or epilpsey or something?

When I am normal, I still feel like I can manage my depression, thoughts and feelings a lot better than when I first had it. But these episodes are really scaring me. Are they just going to get worse and worse?

I've always thought of myself as a coward who would never commit suicide because I'm too scared to die and too scared to inflict pain on myself.

But if these episodes get worse and worse, I feel like it might be possible I may eventually become suicidal.

And if these things are because of genetics or whatever and not curable via say Cognitive behavorial therapy, then I need to do the responsible thing.

Right now, what drives me the most is a wanting of love, wanting of a relationship, to get a girlfriend and start my own family. But if this persists and gets worse, then I should stop because what if I end up committing suicide 10-20 years down the road? That would be tragic for my family/kids. I can't do that to them, that would be too irresponsible.

Also, I'm a relatively newer player and don't have the ability to get a lot of ascension mats. Currently my best char is a maxed Melendor with 5 class upgrades. So... I don't really like how this month's Atlantis has green/dark, which is not really what I need.

What if it was a 80% chance of success? Or a 50% chance of it moving up 10 years with a chance of it being 5 years longer?

I see most people in the FIRE/leanFIRE subs going the absolute ""safe"" route of index funds and such, slowly saving up as much as they can and building their portfolios. 

Has anyone taken a riskier approach to hopefully speed things up (or even reach fatFIRE if you're lucky)? How has that worked out for you?

I'm just at the very start of my journey; arguably I haven't even started. But I'm thinking of going a hybrid route where there's a plan for worst-case scenario where nothing works out, and then there's still a safety net for a very late FIRE, but if everything works out well, then could speed things up significantly.

Like, let's say you can save 30k/year. What if you took 60k at the beginning to do something really risky? Even if you lost it all, that's just 2 extra years to your FIRE. If you're willing to risk 5 years, that's 150k you can risk on high risk high return ventures. 

Probably some form of kelly betting could potentially work well and give you a moonshot chance of FIRE extremely early or fatFIRE, while not delaying your safe FIRE for too long?

Any thoughts/experiences?

For years I wondered why that is, and how is it that others make friends? I put the blame on the fact that I grew up with a different cultural background, I put the blame on the fact that I went to 7 different elementary schools and didn't learn how to socialize.

But those were all excuses. Back then, I was able to socialize, and socialize well. I had lots of friends and was happy, despite the fact I had to change schools pretty much every year.

So why did things change? And how do you make friends?

I thought long and hard about how I made friends back when I was a popular kid. I got nothing. It just... happens. Naturally. 

And if you ask anyone the question ""How do you make friends?"" You're bound to get the same answer. Just meet people, and it happens... naturally.

Same with romantic relationships. How do they happen? Well, they just happen. According to others.

Of course, as an FAer, our response is ""GTFO normie, if it just happens how come it hasn't happened to me?!""

But I finally understand. It really, really does just happen. 

But why doesn't it happen to us? There's only one reason. Because of low self-esteem.

You see, you don't need to do anything special to make friends or even get in a romantic relationship. But because of our low self-esteem, we screw it up before it happens.

We think ""Oh, I'm not good enough to even talk to that girl let alone be her bf."" Or ""She's gonna think I'm a creep if I try to talk to her"" or ""I'm too ugly"". 

We give ourselves excuses, and labels, and then, we build walls in between us and other people. 

Others might not realize this, we might not even realize it ourselves. But our every action, every thought carries with it the pains of low self-esteem, sealing us into our own little bubble, protecting us from getting hurt by others, because we ourselves believe that we are not good enough for a friendship, for love, and that it will inevitably end in failure.

And that is what's keeping us from forming friendships and romantic relationships.

It's easy to say than to fix though; I'm sure most of you are not convinced and are just gonna downvote me for being a normie.

But I'm not a normie. Like I said, I'm 26, KHV, don't even have friends. But I don't want to continue drowning in misery. I want to change. I want to feel good about myself, I want to be able to live happily. And if I can make friends, if I can find a girl who is willing to take me, great. But true happiness ultimately begins with ourselves.

And I invite you all to give yourselves a chance as well. You deserve better.

I began taking steps. I started swimming every day again. I started contacting my mom again. I am trying to make friends (If any of you are lonely and want a friend, feel free to message me and add me on wechat/whatsapp or whatever!). 

I joined this thing called Toastmaster, it's a club to train public speaking skills and leadership skills, and also a way to meet people and fix my social anxiety.

I've given a few speeches at toastmasters since then, and I want to share some of them with you guys. Maybe you guys will relate, maybe it will give you guys some food for thought. Hopefully it will.

I hope we can all work together, and get out of the pain and misery that plagues us.

Anyway my speeches:

The Denou-sen is being held to commemorate all of the past ""milestone"" opponents DeepZenGo faced through its development.

The first game of the Denou-sen was held on March 24th in Beijing against Mi Yuting. After this, there will be two other games, held on April 1st in Seoul against Park Junghwan, and on April 7th in Tokyo against Cho Chikun for the finale. 

According to Mr. Kato, developer of Zen, the original goal for the DeepZenGo project was to surpass AlphaGo Lee's level. It was never intended to be a long term project. And from what they can see, DeepZenGo has already surpassed AlphaGo Lee, so it is a good time for it to come to an end.

When asked if he would continue developing Zen by himself, he replied that he could not reveal that information at this time. (edit: read another article where he says that the development of Zen will definitely continue, but he's not the main developer, only the spokesman of the Zen team)

Since June 21st, 2017, til March 16th, 2018, DeepZenGo has played 3407 games against pros from the Nihon Kiin.

In those games, it managed to win 3228 games and lose 119 games, for a 96.5% winrate. 


Edit: Almost forgot, DeepZenGo unfortunately lost to Mi Yuting in the first game. I say unfortunately not because I want DeepZenGo to win, but because it only lost because of a mistake that even someone like me (ama 1dish) could see; it literally gave away 4 points for free. So DeepZenGo still has mistakes like these sometimes :(

Alot of shit happened tbh.



Basically my friend of 19 years fucked me over something trivial and it really kind of threw me into something I suspect to be the beginning of a depressive episode.


I‘m trying my hardest just to be ""normal"" depressed but it gets harder. I just feel sad and worthless.


I bought concert tickets and then asked her if she wants to come along and if not, I‘ll just resell the left ones. She said before I actually bought them she‘s not sure because she didn‘t have alot of money but once I had them she said she wants to. She told me though she can’t instantly pay and I offered help, because well duh - friends do that. 


She asked me if she can have the other ticket for her boyfriend and I said yes but lowkey I was already kind of meh about the fact she didn‘t even ask if I was ok with him coming... Also she said she will pay for her boyfriend and herself (wtf).


Cue - she says she‘ll pay off in April and I asked her constantly if that‘s really doable for her since she’s wearing the costs for 2 people and if she really wants to even go because she said she had financial problems. 


She said yes for a whole month, kept saying she will pay it. But once was April approaching, she said it will be April-May. To which I asked her why it‘d be May when we said April and she told me about how she has to pay shit for her boyfriend.


I talked about it with my therapist and she helped me find courage to tell my friend that I want the money in Mid-April like she originally said and she was like ""Ok, but I can only pay half of the money"" and yada yada yada. So I said ok because any money is better than no money and I was in financial problems...


I usually never ask for my money because I‘m always scared being an inconvenience to anyone... but it is my money so I have every right to ask for it.


But then a few days laters she said because something was up with the insurance of her boyfriend she can‘t pay me till May. I was not thrilled at all about this but said ok, I will wait till May. 


And then she said a day later she‘s not sure if she can come at all and that we (WE - AS IN HER, HER BOYFRIEND AND I) have to wait till his stupid ass might be taken for a job so he can earn money. If he doesn‘t get the job she can‘t come at all and guess what happened - he didn‘t get the job.


So I was fucking left on 280€, a whole month of my life AND money was wasted, she abused my trust and prioritized her boyfriend over someone she always calls ""sister"". Well yeah, fuck you too. 


19 fucking years. We‘ve known for 19 fucking years and she has always been mistreating me like this.


Anyway, I needed space so I can articulate what made me angry about the situation so I ignored her. I talked about this with my therapist too and after that told her everything what made me angry.


She disappointed me, she wasted my time, she wasted my money and she treated my trust like it‘s nothing. 


Her response was just her excusing herself and making her apology redundant. She was like ""bla bla bla I thought I can do it but I overestimated me, I didn‘t expect this to happen, I feel so bad and I have a bad concious and didn‘t want to add stress"".


Well, thanks for doing all of that ANYWAY.


I made a whole 1h long voice mail explaining to her that she can‘t do that with me, she can‘t excuse herself like that because it doesn‘t make it ok, that I personally would‘ve never even risked playing with someone‘s time and money like that and yada yada yada.


But she didn‘t really care, she was just like ""yeah we talked enough about it already... you don‘t know everything about his situation"" (her boyfriend).



As if any of that matters anyway, she harmed me and can‘t even really apologize.


I remember one time I was having suicidal thoughts, was depressed and she told me ""well see you in your grave then"" because she was so angry and frustrated at me. She only ""apologized"" after her ex boyfriend called her out for being someone who used him and him insulting her looks etc. and she feeling like shit over it. Because it happened to her and then she  ""apologized"" and told me ""she finally understands"".



Hmmm sure.


It‘s deeper than the concert tickets, many of my friends are like that.


To them I‘m just this decoration that they sometimes can use. No one really gives a fuck about my feelings, it‘s always about them. And it keeps happening and happening and it makes me feel really worthless.


She knew my life is shit currently, that I have trouble with university, my parents are ill, the owner of our house probably selling the house, me having financial problems. She knows all of it and yet decided to fuck me over like that.


Her offering me ""Please let me help with the tickets"" doesn‘t mean jack shit. You‘re just trying to clean off your bad concience instead of having a backbone.


this makes me so upset. Every single time people in my life don‘t give a shit about me and my feelings.


I feel lonely and misunderstood, I feel useless, I feel over sensitive. I just want everyone to leave me alone forever.

I am already in therapy (for almost 2 years now)

I am also already taking anti depressants and I have sedative drops for the panic attacks.
I also had a psychiatric semi-stay.

I really did everything possible and even more to combat it.


But after all the effort, I still get massive panic attacks when it comes to my Arabic exam.


I‘ve been postponing it since 2017.

Back then my ex broke up with me (in August 2016) and it fucked me over so much that I couldn‘t take any exams. 

I was in a depressive episode for almost a year.


In 2018 during exam time back then, I fell into another depressive episode and had huge panic attacks.


And this year again. Again and again and again.


My fear of studying has been there since I started with school (age 6). I cannot remember a time where I *didn‘t* have a panic attack during trying to studying, especially when I noticed that I didn‘t understand a subject.


Honestly, I think it‘s kind of my mom‘s fault. She used to scream and insult me alot as a child when I didn‘t understand something immediately. 

It didn‘t help that my teachers wanted to send me into a special ED class because I was ""too slow"".


All my life I felt too stupid to achieve anything and I hated myself because I just couldn‘t handle the pressure and give results others and myself were happy with.


Everytime there is an ounce of force, I shut down and get anxiety.


I‘m so fucking sick of being this way, it ruined me and it ruined my education too.


I know my mental health comes first but I can‘t help but feel like an utter failure.


Just an hour ago I saw my Arabic exam study stuff and I almost threw up.

I‘ve studied several hours a day for 2 months straight for that exam while having constant panic attacks and now I associate studying even more with fear, failure and just the crushing feeling of ""I‘m too dumb to do this"".



My original major would‘ve lasted 8 semesters, I‘m in semester 7 now. 
But because I postponed it so much it stacked up to 14 semesters in total. I cannot do thus for another 3,5 years, I just can‘t.


That‘s why I‘ll change my major (Islamic science) with my minor (educational science).

I have really great grades in educational science because it‘s easy and with my major I did enough to cover it as a minor (when you change, you can add all the creditpoints later on).


That way, only Arabic will be left next year and I won‘t even have to study for 14 semesters.


ALthough I already dread having to write this piece of shit exam.


I never learned how to cope correctly and I‘m angry because if I hadn‘t been treated like that and if I had the proper resources back then, I wouldn‘t be such a fuck up.


I feel so fucked up and worthless simply because I‘m too dumb to study. It makes me so depressed and all my mental illnesses make it harder for me anyway...



I‘m sorry, I just had to rant. I‘m just so fucking sick of everything and everyone

I also have rheumatism and Asthma and sometimes it prevents me from doing things that could benefit my mental health.

I sadly have a bunch of diagnoses.

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?


I‘m Turkish/Kurdish and muslim so I didn‘t have as many privileges as my of my european peers but since my mom also grew up in Germany and also in Alevi confession (which usually are very liberal muslims), I had much more freedom than many other muslims. 

But my parents were strict and there were/are still alot of fights between my parents (literally about everything) and my mom‘s side of family is fucked up so yeah, had to witness shit I never wanted to witness and it did affect me alot.

I remember my childhood very vividly and it‘s kinda retro-diagnosed that I suffered from childhood depression. 

I used to never eat and got mentally abused for it. I remember instances where I just got screamed at for not eating and that I was doing it on purpose but I just wasn‘t hungry and felt either sad or numb.

As child, I asked myself alot why am I exactly on earth, why I see through my eyes and if people wouldn‘t just be better off without me. 
Didn‘t help when I got blamed or got called dumb when I was lacking in school. It was always ""you‘re lazy and do nothing"" but I know I was just too depressed to do anything even as a kid.


• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I‘m a university student (7th Semester) and like earlier mentioned, I study Islamic Science and Educational science but I want to switch those 2.

I do like both subjects but for Islamic science I have to study Arabic and since 2016-17 I am postponing my Arabic exam because my mental health issues just prevent me from being able to write it and it always triggers panic attacks and depressive episodes.

So I want to switch them so I can focus on educational science more and just finally write this stupid exam and never touch Arabic/Islamic science again. It made my studies and semesters way longer than it should‘ve originally been :(

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?


Refreshed, I love being alone and I‘m also always in my room alone. I can‘t deal with much or loud social interactions and sometimes I wish I lived alone.


• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?


I used to do alot of sports when I was a teenager but I stopped because back then I didn‘t had my Asthma diagnosis and I was just depressed in general so I had no energy to do it, on top of feeling like always dying when I did sports.

I used to be fit and okay-ish but now I don‘t do any sports and I‘m also too scared to start alone.


• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?


When I‘m not depressed, I am really a curious person, who thinks alot and kinda lives in a dreamworld sometimes.

I‘m curious about stuff that interests me (like music, arts, politics, memes, idk stuff I just like). But if it‘s stuff I don‘t like, I don‘t want to do anything with it.

I‘m not a native English speaker so I don‘t quite get the last question but I think my ideas are more conceptual? I like dreaming alot or automatically have scenarious in my head how things could be/look etc. but I almost never can execute them. But I have alot of ideas, deep thoughts and creativity in me.


• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

No, I don‘t want to take leadership positions, it‘d make me crazy. All these responsibilities and the fear of disappointing people would be too big to handle for me. 

I don‘t know if I‘d be good at it, I‘m more of someone finding compromises and someone being helpful from the backround. I‘m not even really a follower because I do stand up for my own ideals and opinions but I also really can‘t lead anyone, I think.


• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I think I kinda am? I like playing piano if that helps, not that I‘m good but I like it and I also like crafting stuff (with clay) and I‘m good at catching things or playing around with a pen and my fingers

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

Yes, I am! I have some art posts on my reddit (I‘ll link it). 

I like to draw right eyes the most and I draw them unintentionally sometimes. it‘s like an instinct to draw it because it calms me down. I also sometimes like to work with colours and I really like cross hatching!

I‘m a mix of drawing realistically but having my distinct style. After drawing eyes, I loooove doodles with many different symbolds and patterns. I‘m often caught up with details tho so when I don‘t do well, I feel really depressed.


I enjoy Van Gogh‘s art alot, also doodles,  Fanart and hyperrealistical ones


• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I don‘t know, the past made me who I am today but there are many things I wish that didn‘t happen. I don‘t like it when people say they‘re thankful for it. I might have changed for the better but I still wish I hadn‘t done certain things or that certain things had happened to me.


The present it kinda like the past, it‘s linked to it, imo. We live in the present a certain way due to our experiences and present easily becomes past.
I don‘t really live in the present for the present‘s sake, it just is a state that I live in and accept. 
I don‘t have a fear of missing out because constantly something happens anyway.
even if the present is not special or exciting, I live in it and it/I just exist(s). Even the bad moments happen and scare you, you just live through it. 
Sometimes it feels like you‘ll always be stuck in one emotion/one way of thought and that might be true for the present‘s being but not for the future. I get tired of the present sometimes though because I don‘t want to experience anything at all.


The future scares me and my anxiety doesn‘t help with it at all. Sometimes I wish I‘d know what happens. The best moment of the future is when it turns into the past. The future is so uncertain and scary. 

I just want to live in a timeless zone. I‘m talking bullshit probably lmao

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I just help because it‘s my first impulse to do so. I‘d get a bad concience if I didn‘t help because I know it feels like shit not getting help. If I can, I will, if not, I will try anyway and be emotional support then.

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

No, I‘m the least logical person in existence, I don‘t care much about it nor do I understand logic that much to be honest. I‘m dumb lmao

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

I don‘t have to be efficient or productive. I mean sometimes it‘s important but to me it‘s not the most important thing in my life.


• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Not really, I‘m usually the one being controlled even if I don‘t like it. I am not a dominant person so it‘s hard for me to controll anyone.


• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

I like drawing, playing piano, reading mangas, watching videos, writing stuff like poems, some mobile games and editing memes etc.

I do it because I feel like I can be myself when I do this. It expresses me well or distracts me from life.

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?


I have no learning style, my learning style consists getting panic attacks because I realize I‘m shit at learning. 
I struggle with anything that has to do with a system, standartized shit or force (like school or university) and I learn the best when I have fun because I don‘t percieve it as learning then.


Creative subjects or political or societal ones are my best subjects.


• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

Honestly I‘m shit at strategizing and a huge procrastinator, I‘m probably more of an improviser or last minute-doer


• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

Honest to god, I just want to live on an only island as a fisher with my animals and do music and art but since it‘ll never happen, I‘d wanna work with children who have no real person they can relay on so I can help them.


• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I fear death eventho I wanna die lmao, I feae life because I don‘t know what the fuck is going to happen. I fear studying because it always shows me how dumb I am and people yelling at me, because it also shows me how incompetent I am.

Physical contact makes me uncomfortable, I feel easily violated... 


I only hate people that are bigots, racists and assholes. I don‘t like arrogant people who hurt others and are selfish.



• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?


Doing things and forgetting the future for a while. Just feeling at complete ease with life and myself. When I‘m alone and no one bothers me.

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

My depressive episodes and the times I want to die and ask myself why I‘m the way I am.

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I daydream alot but I‘m very perceptive of people around me and I‘m good at analyzing them or seeing what kind of people they are.

Usually I am aware of what‘s happening around me when I daydream but sometimes I daydream way too hard and get lost lmao

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

tbh ""Cool, I think I‘m gonna nap""

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

It takes me alot of time because I‘m very insecure but I usually go with my gut feeling and when my gut feeling is right I don‘t change it anymore and am gonna do it.

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

Sometimes it takes time especially when I’m depressed or in a depressive episode because these are very heavy feelings to process. Emotions are very important for me in general, I don‘t show it but I‘m a very emotion driven person. 
More of a ""trust your gut"" kinda person and I think emotionality should be way more important for everyone because to me society is too cold...

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?


Sometimes, when I‘m insecure but most of the times I tell people (in a kind way) that I don‘t agree with them 100% and they should look at ir from a different perspective. But that I understand their point of view (if it‘s one that isn‘t hurtful to someone else)


• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?


I don‘t break rules and I have trouble to do so myself bur I do thing authority should be challenged. We‘re all equal and just because someone has authority does not mean they have every right over you.",old gender give us gener descript femal pretti petit small also turkish kurdish germani studi

Just want someone to gym with).She is currently 35She is bipolar depressive but manages her medication well and no signs of freak outsOne divorced but with very few partners.She is very loyal and caring towards meBuys me things and is worried about my health etc. I bought her things.Always down to hang out and or wait on me for things. Helped me out through rough patches. I helped her as much as I could

About me:I work in insurance. First year pulled around 40k after taxes.I make a little money from actingI have a side business I resell online but I haven't touched the funds on thatI live on my own but I drive an old car(for now but it gets me from point A to B)I plan on going out to ATL or LA for more work.I'm not bad looking.I didn't finish college but if I go back it would be for a complete career change instead of just completing something for the sake of doing so.

I'm not sure how I should go about this transition. Should I start looking for someone else? Should I chill? I am very lost because we were together for 3 years. She was my rock. She did a lot for me. She's meeting with me on Friday so I can try to talk to here. I'm not sure what to do.

Same thing with day 2. I talked with girls that i consider much hotter than me, i would even approach the groups of 5-6 girls with no problem. I also managed to dance with the hottest girl in the club for quite some time, and things were getting pretty close.
And then the day 3 came, which destroyed all of my ideals. Suddenly nothing worked on girls anymore, they would reject me from the get go and wouldnt even try to dance with me, and most of my friends, and i dont want to say it like this, but worse looking than me, that also had much less confidence were getting girls, same with day 4.
I attampted to talk with a girl by sitting next to her, which worked on days 1 and 2, but suddenly failed on 3 and 4, mainly the same way, they would give me this disturbed look which would immediatly push me away.
If somebody could help me with this i would be very thankful, as i am very depressed right now. Thank god my cobfidence is not all ruined, since im gonna try tommorkw as well, but i really feel like shit right now.

Think about it. You have no idea what goes on in their head yet have the fucking audacity to say that life gets better and they shouldn't do it. Dumbass. Life might get better for you, but do you know their situation? Do you know how much trauma they may go through? Do you not stop and think for a second that the quality of life of a human who has prayers of death and anguish to come at him full force should be alive? Ignorant. 

""But that's not fair. Life does get better for everyone. You shouldn't tell someone to kill themselves."" You're the biggest fucking hypocrite. Telling someone that they shouldn't kill themselves and that everyone loves them doesn't fix their mental situation. Maybe they don't want help. Maybe they don't want to be alive. Why on this fucking earth should we be forced to sit here and endure the world's shit when death is an organic, simple option. Don't wanna cry because you're afraid you might lose x because they're depressed and want to die? Really? That's pretty selfish imo.

Long story short, I have ADHD, Bipolar 1, Generalized Anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder. The longer I stay, the harder it is to fight back against the depression. Its even worse when when your counselor, school therapist, and my medical therapist are all saying that I need to stop going. Its gotten to the point where my medical therapist can give me a medical leave of absence. At some point, they might do it forcefully.

However, I was doomed to go. My Dad thinks I'm ""to smart"" despite the results confirming I am suffering from these illnesses. Thinks I'm lazy, and that I don't try at all. He says, ""people with cancer have it much worse"" then what I have. My grandparents are no better. They want me to stay no matter what, and to keep going. I can't keep doing this. Its making my symptoms worse, no matter how many times I beg to stop going. I can't handle a school environment, and has been this way my entire life. The longer I stay, the worse I get. Its getting harder and harder to fight back the suicidal thoughts. I can't quit because they won't let me quit. What do I do?

Then when Apex Legends came out, I dismissed it as another BR game. Then I hear so many good things come about it, and heard it was different, so I gave it a shot.

Nope. Just another BR game, but now I'm absolutely stuck with teammates.

Just like in Fortnite, When I try to play with teammates, they usually leave me for dead, teabagging my body or ""Okay, okay, I'm reviving you--NAH. Jk.""

Another was me starting out another one. Figured I just had a shit team. But then I get harrassed on Voice Chat. I don't even use it. Nor is there an option to completely turn it off. 

Its the same damn thing in Apex, but for some reason it happened more to me in this game than any other BR game.

For most of my life, I have been suffering from school. I'm just not happy when I'm there. Its a struggle. I can't do anything. I try to force myself, but it soon becomes exhausting.

For most of my life, from middle to high school, I failed. No matter how hard I tried. Even with help, I was barely able to keep up.

My Dad would constantly rant at me. Get angry. ""Why are you being lazy?"" ""Sometimes I wonder if you're doing this on purpose.""

I tried my absolute hardest, and if it weren't for my ranting Dad, I most likely would've dropped high school all together.

For a long time, I never understood why I was having such a hard time. I felt lazy, unmotivated, and I really did want to try, but I could never bring myself to do it. I hated myself for being like this. I hated that I was like this. Would constantly cry about why I couldn't do anything. I wanted to hurt myself many times, but to afraid to even do that.

I finally passed High school was an even 2 GPA. I thought I was done. I can finally do my own thing, do my own dreams. But no. College is my next priority, and I have no say on if I wanted to go or not.

So back at it again. And I'm failing. My Counselor took me to the Disability Service, and they told me I most likely have ADHD. Told my Dad, and he knew all along.

I was angry. Why did I suffer for so freaking long, if you knew I was suffering?? Why would you LET me fall? I asked him if I can take meds, and he said no. If he could make it, so can I, he implies. I have no money to even afford meds on my own, so not much there. And my Ma is consistantly broke.

So...I'm on my own. My GPA is now at an all time low, at 1.19 (it was at 0.89), I'm falling behind on my classes. I feel like a failure, as not once since I entered middle school have I ever been able to impress my Ma or my Dad that I can get good grades. I can't really do anything. I feel like a toddler who constantly needs to be held. I can't do anything without help. I don't even think I'll do well later in life. I don't have much to go on nowadays. I'm just going through the motions just being emotionally upset. 

I feel like a failure...

I know this isn't much, but I don't know what to do. I figured I can just rant here. Try and fit in.

I wanna quit...sometimes life in general. To scared to do that though...




EDIT: Forgot a TL:CR

TL;DR: Map Bug tends to remove players location from both mini map and regular map, but not the world map. It doesn't go away, nor does anyone know how its triggered. It just shows and leaves whenever it feels like it. No moves from developer yet. People have reported this, but I'm wondering if anyone else experienced this.

This may be just me (or, at least around the Xbox One version of Tera) but apparently there's this Map Bug in the console versions of the game.

Its one random bug. I dunno what triggers it, nor what fixes it, but its there. This bug kindly screws you over the worst way possible. It screws with your mini map, and your second largest map. It doesn't mess with the world map, thank goodness, but it happens to the other ones.

For console players (Idk what its like on PC), on your mini map and your slightly larger map, it shows your characters location facing wherever the character is looking with a blue arrow, while the camera has its cone shaped view. This bug completely removes it, and leaves you stranded whenever you leave town. Unstuck your character, download and redownload, instant match, nothing. It does not go way as easy. I don't know what triggers it either.

Reason I'm posting this is because when I told the support group I was having this problem, they informed me that *Others HAVE reported this*, but so far, the developers haven't made a move about it. They MIGHT fix it within the next update.

So if you guys are experiencing the Map Bug, know that others have tried.

Penny Belle, a 14 yr old student in middle school, is actually bullied by her classmates. The only thing she has going for her is her Mother, Nanna Belle.

She comes home as usual, but today was a lot worse than usual. She tries to find her Mom only to find a very old tape recorder, and a necklace stringing a metal ball. She wears the necklace, then listens to the tape, finding out that her mother is a Pinball Warrior, and she was facing the menacing Black Knight 3000 today, though her mother knew she wouldn't make it back. Penny was suppose to listen to it after she moved to a safer place. To late now.

Her Mother arrives home, finds out that her daughter is now a Pinball Warrior, as the necklace now refuses its old owner. Penny and her Mother now need to find a way to beat the Black Knight 3000 without either of them being destroyed.

Later, they were able to successfully drive away the Black Knight, of course, without some injuries. The pinball holds strange powers, able to make her into a physical pinball, and her attacks being formed in a point system. Black Knight reveals that her enemies will be back to destroy the warrior once and for all.

Nanna is now baffled. She was so sure she defeated every single evil boss out there. Had they already returned? Penny hugs her Mom and tells her, ""I got this, Mom! I'll beat every last one of them!""

Similar to Soldier 76's run, make Mei do the same. When Soldier runs, his gun is not available until he's off his running ability. Mei should be the same. Have Mei point her blaster slightly downwards, with a little addition of lucio's skating animation to show she's now on the move, without having the need to look for ants on the ground. Since she's using her blaster as a way to skate, it should take up ammo, so she can't freely skate everywhere she wants. Her speed should be a little faster than lucio (without amping his speed), but slower than Soilder when he's running.

Its simple, but I always thought *why not just point her gun slightly downwards, not able to shoot and not looking for pennies, similiar to Soilder when he's running?*

This is LONG, so... 

TL;DR - Special needs kid was bullied by three girl douches. A student stood up for the kid, including a female student and me. Neither of us got in trouble, but the douche girls did. Yay happy ending. 

ACTUAL STORY --

School comes around, middle school. There's this special needs kid. He was nice, bright, but very annoying and slow, to be honest. He spoke in blurts and jumbled English (keep this in mind. Its important later), but he was hyperactive. This kid (Jimmy for now) was nice. Every once in a while, Jimmy came in with a batch of cookies while simultaneously blurting, ""FWIENDS!!"" to us, which we replied, ""best friends."" He was happy, and although he was loud and annoying, we were proud he smiled through the hardships. (At least, I was. Idk about others.)

Then Douche A, Douche B, and Douche Leader C comes in, like a random fucking Pokemon from the bushes. Douche A acted like the leader, because she was ""hard"". Douche B was ""The Bitch."" Not the slutty type, but the obnoxious type. THAT bitch. And Douche C was the REAL leader. She would point at a person, and that person would their lives ruined. Yes, they were ALL girls. 

Jimmy tried to give them some brownies he once brought instead of cookies for a change. However, because he spoke jumbled English, Douche A decided to make fun of them. I actually remember how the conversation went, because I was so livid at them.

Keep in mind, fellow Dolan's, this was in MIDDLE SCHOOL. Yeah...

D1: ""The fuck is this??""

Jimmy: ""Food!!""

D2: ""And you brought brownies. Like...what even is this?""

J: ""F-... Food??""

D1: ""Speak fucking english you retardation bastard. What is this?""

J: ""I-I...got food. Me bring food fur fwiends. Fooood??"" *Tries handing them plate of brownies, which D2 glady slaps back onto his shirt.*

D3: ""I can't understand this fucking retard. I'm surprise his parents haven't put him down yet. He's so fucking retarded.""

J: *His cross eyes get the better of him, and he starts to cry.* ""I-I'm sorry. Me bring cookies?""

D1: ""Fuck off.""

D2 promptly then snatches away all the happiness he had left by spitting on his shoe. 

At that point, ALL of the students around were livid. L-I-V-I-D. Pissed. Before we could go COD Zombies Round 40 on their ass, one of the students long got up (I never saw him get up. Fucking amazing), grabbed D2 by the shirt, and just roasted her, standing up for Jimmy. D1 then tried to fight back said kid, only for another student (girl) took one big ass swing to D1's jaw. D3 realized mistake, only for me to show up, and promptly WWE RKO her fucking throat.

Long story short, it was a big struggle between 3v3. We all got in trouble later. How much trouble? Not much. Lol. 

We were defending, and they (glady) didn't call our parents. The girls, however, weren't seen again. Jimmy went straight back to happy, but then ONLY brought cookies, just in case the girls came back.

Keep in mind, I wad in high school, so it was around January earlier this year. I'm off to college soon, so...yeah.

This didn't happen to me, but my friend bragged about it arrogantly, and I couldn't help bit chuckle, and be baffled in disbelief. 

Apparently, my buddy Pedro was dating a girl in his band class. They were practically inseparable. You could not get them alone even if you tried. So my buddy, Ralph, decided that he DELIBERATELY wanted to ruin Pedro's relationship.

He flirted with Pedro's girlfriend, (we'll call her Tammy, I honestly don't know her) then later got a bit more intimate with her. I asked, ""Huh, but you know they are inseparable, yeah? No way you did it.""

""Oh yeah. I know."" Ralph said cocky, ""but tell me this: do you see them together now?""

I didn't. I really didn't. The fucker pulled it off. He was smug about it too. To make matters worse, she apparently never had SEX before. So she did her first time with Ralph, then decided to never tell Pedro about it. One of my friends found out and told him. I don't know how he handled it, but then SHE decided to tell Pedro herself. And to add the hot spicy pepper on that boiling pan, she WANTED to date him, only then turned around to go after Ralph, who then, in his words, said, ""Nope. Sorry."" With a smug on his face. 

The devil. 

Well, that's my story. Hope you guys like it. This may sound fake, but honest to God, its real. I couldn't stop laughing because I thought he was lying too, only then did it make sense. He's done A LOT worse, same concept, but this one I consider messed up.

He just was there and understood. But he passed and now i am scared of what will happen without him here by my side, helping me fight my demons.

I was at work so I went off and did my business about 2 hours a come back and just glanced at my phone. I had a missed call from a number i did not recognise and than a text message from that caller. 

I opened the text ""This is Glenns missus, can you call me back please?"" I replied instantly ""Hi, is everything ok?"" I waited, holding my breathe until i received her reply of ""oh darling, no one has told you. No it really isnt ok."" 

The last time I spoke to my good friend Glenn was 2 months prior and we ended our conversation on him saying ""just over life fucking me over"" as our conversations were usually half finished either on his part for forgetting to reply or my part because i went to bed. And it wouldnt pick back up until a week or a month later. 

This last time was the longest i had gone without messaging him, but i had been busy, very depressed, troubles with work and my relationship. But i missed him so much so i found the time to message him. 

I called his Missus once i was home because i did start thinking the worst (i am very pessimistic) and she was in tears instantly. She had found him on the bedroom floor on December 5th 2018 and they had held his funeral on the 20th. I was devastated but only a few tears escaped my eyes. 

21st december is my mothers birthday so after this shocking noise i grabbed her birthday presents and headed over to hers. When i got there i burst into tears and started to sob uncontrollably. 

You were such an amazing friend, we had such great and fun times together. We spoke about everything under the sun and I truly wish I could of done more for you and could of attended your funeral. I love you Glenn, i hope you are happier wherever you are now.

One says selfish and a waste and the other sounds like they committed a crime.

These poor people who do this are fighting a battle just like people fight cancer. Why cant people say ""he/she lost her battle to depression"" i feel its a type of cancer, just not physical and most times people arent cured from it, it just lays dormant or is just a sickness we carry everyday.

It really upsets me that some people thinks its selfish and a waste, this person was clearly suffering and obviously felt no one cared and couldnt get the help they needed. They fought their demons for too long by themselves and just couldnt fight any longer. 

Ok people are left suffering when this happens, but if you helped them whilst they were suffering perhaps it wouldnt of happened. Sometimes they just cant do it anymore, and i dont blame them, this world is a horrid place.

And omg it is helping me so much. 

Its just like a diary but better! You put your own choice of pages in. For example i have a mood tracker, sleep log, exercise log and a weightloss tracker. Just to name a few and you can have whatever you like! From savings/spending pages, meal planners, yearly/weekly or daily goals. Cleaning routine, study routine. Anything really. Your imagination (or the imagination of the world) is the limit!

All you need is a journal and a few pens. I found that a dotted journal is perfect as it gives me room to create without hard lines but still with a guide. You can make it as pretty or as systematic as you like. Its all up to you, after all it is YOUR bullet journal. 

This has helped so much with my depression lately, ive been feeling very suicidal and this has helped keep my mind off of those thoughts for i am concentrating on designing my journal and filling it in and also you can always add to it. There is no limit of what you can do with your bullet journal. 

Creative or not, i feel that this could truly change someones life. You can try gratitude pages or a page with positive quotes or even a self care page that you can look at for ideas on what to do when your feeling down. 

I hope you look into this and if it interests you to try it.

I am so over trying to please people and make them atleast nod in approval... when all i do is wrong.. yet i cant stop.. what people think and what they want is so important to me. 

I have never been the one who cares much about myself. I am a giver and i always want everyone else to be happy, i always help where i can, but nothing is good enough. 

Maybe im just being stupid but why is this world full of such shit people.. people that only care for themselves and no one else, who dont try to better or support or sympathise with others. They just let you keep failing, yell at you when something isnt good enough or just blankly avoid you when they know you just want a small lil rant. 

Im not even talking to my partner about things even though he would support me to the ends of the universe but i just dont want to upset him or worry him because i know that will happen. But even so i feel he is over caring for me.. and i dont blame him...

Ive been having these thoughts and feelings myself for years. And funnily enough i found my calling in the profession i am in now in that need. 

I rarely ever felt love by anyone, even partners. Though i have been one to pick them 😕 but i went to have a facial once at my local beauty spa and for the first time in a long time i felt love. Yes it may not be the love like a partner would give or the love you would feel from a family member. But it was love, nuture, care, sensitivity. This is why i became a beauty therapist to give people love through touch. 

So i would like to just say, try and go out and get yourself a massage or a facial. Treat yourself if you can. A manicure or a pedicure. Sometimes you may need to shop around for the beauty therapist that gives you those feelings. But it is so nice when you find it. Find someone who is a stranger but generally cares for you. Im lucky to have that joy every time i treat a client. 

Also treat yourself every once in a while you all deserve it. You are all beautiful beings and intelligent. You deserve to be pampered 😍😍

So many frown on the deed, yet how many of those who frown try to talk, comfort, help or even try to grasp an understanding of the persons reason for doing it? None. They just judge, make assumptions, like ""it's just for attention"" or think of us as weak. 

""WHAT IS THAT?! WHY ARE YOU CUTTING AGAIN?!"" Is something I hear often from my mother. She demands an explanation when she sees new scars. And questions if i tell my psychologist. 
No concern for if her daughter is feeling ok. No checking suicide isn't stalking her mind. No comfort is shown, even in her questions. Just questions on why I would do such a ""stupid"", unproductive, mutilating thing to myself. 

I never mean for her to see them, I never mean for anyone to ever see them. It is my pain and I prefer to keep it to myself instead of burdening others hearts with pity, empathy or sympathy for my pain. 
But sometimes i can't help that my short pants ride up one scar to high or my dress gets blown to reveal my band on scars. I can't help the small things from slipping at the wrong time, resulting in that disappointment and anger in my mothers eyes and tone. 

There has never been any empathy that this is the only release i have to be constant. That even after all these years and after attempting so many other forms of ""release"" to help me deal with the pain that tears through my chest like a black hole, to help me breathe normally without really thinking ""in 1, 2, 3 out 1, 2, 3"", the only thing that settles my scattered, negative and destructive mind is to grab a pair of scissors, pull apart my razors to get the blades out or to scratch at my skin until there is no skin left to scratch.

Depression has gotten the best of me. Despite trying to explain how difficult and challenging it is to just stay afloat, i lost my job.

Ive asked for help and there were a handful of kind souls whove done so to the best they can.. but whats heartbreaking is that the people you actually thought you can count on, just turned their cold shoulders, and cries fell on deaf ears.. and some would say its just the depression talking..

There were even a few who were harsh enough to play tricks.. maybe its amusing to them how one can be so down, so helpless, so desperate for help that one cant do anything but follow their every whim and then left hanging..

I understand the cynicism, the doubt, but the harshness and being mean.. it completely escapes me..

I know ending my life isnt the answer, and it will no longer do any good given that ive lost my insurance as it comes with the job...

but thinking of how to go from here to a better day, a better life.. im all out of answers... im just tired and its whats overwhelming as I used to be a very resilient person.

I was deeply depressed for years of my life, avoiding friends and family and isolating myself constantly. Not only did I have insecurities (thought I was a hideous monster that no one would ever love) but I hated myself severely for having those insecurities. I thought that I was weak, pathetic, and worthless for caring so much and being so unhappy with myself. I thought that was another flaw on my already huge list of perceived flaws.

Due to some books I discovered, I started regularly practicing watching my thought/emotion patterns and what triggered my depressive episodes, and listening to teachings about the mind and how we form our concepts of the world and ourselves. And over time I began to realize something that blew my mind...

**it's not, nor has it EVER been my fault that my mind contains insecurities and self-judgments. and the ones you have aren't your fault either.**

From the moment I was old enough to understand the messages around me (probably a toddler), I was absorbing tons of them, from all kinds of sources, about what makes a human worthy enough, good enough, attractive enough. All these ideas entering my subconscious without me even realizing it. And all said ideas having originated from arbitrary, artificial social constructions passed down through dated cultural norms and corrupted even more by capitalism's drive to make you feel inferior if you don't buy xyz. In other words, bullshit.

How could it possibly be my fault, that I grew up being brainwashed with bullshit about how I ""should"" judge, perceive, and feel about myself? Knowing now how the subconscious works - how it just absorbs information depending on what we're exposed to repeatedly - in retrospect I see that I couldn't have possibly *chosen* to intake and keep repeating these thoughts that were causing me so much pain and suffering. In fact it's almost as if they were implanted without my approval, and allowed to grow like parasites in my mind (fucking up my brain chemistry as well) because I didn't realize what was happening. And by the time I became a young adult, my life had just became a constant attempt to cope with or run from the pain of believing all of those lies (that I didn't know were lies) and constantly judging myself based on them.

**And I think this same thing is happening (in varying degrees and intensities) to everyone who was raised with these kinds of insecurity-creating ideas** being fed to them (and they can come in MANY forms); ESPECIALLY when there are things like trauma, abuse and bullying involved, but even without that.

I look around me today and even many people who ""seem"" happy on the surface appear to be afflicted with these same mental parasites from what they were subconsciously taught and never realized was bullshit. People who are already conventionally attractive getting more surgery and wearing more makeup to look ""better"". People who are already rich hoarding money and cars and jewelry and always trying to get more. Why? What the fuck is driving this constant dissatisfaction?

It seems like the key to being truly at peace, or at least one of the first major steps, is realizing -- not just intellectually knowing but **TRULY realizing, to the core of your being** \-- that most of what we've been taught about happiness and how to obtain it is bullshit. And that in fact, simply continuing to believe those lies by default, instead of seeing them for the farce that they are, might just be one of the biggest factors responsible for a LOT of human suffering and depression.",deepli depress year life avoid friend famili isol constantli insecur thought hideou monster one would ever love hate sever insecur thought weak pathet worthless care much unhappi thought anoth flaw alreadi huge list perceiv flaw due book discov start regularli practic watch thought emot pattern trigger depress episod listen teach mind form concept world time began realiz someth blew mind ever fault mind contain insecur self judgment one fault either moment old enough understand messag around probabl toddler absorb ton all kind sourc make human worthi enough good enough attract enough all idea enter subconsci without even realiz all said idea origin arbitrari artifici social construct pass date cultur norm corrupt even capit drive make feel inferior buy xyz word bullshit could possibl fault grew brainwash bullshit judg perceiv feel know subconsci work absorb inform depend expos repeatedli retrospect see possibl chosen intak keep repeat thought caus much pain suffer fact almost implant without approv allow grow parasit mind fuck brain chemistri well realiz happen time becam young adult life becam constant attempt cope run pain believ all lie know lie constantli judg base think thing happen vari degre intens everyon rais kind insecur creat idea fed come mani form especi thing trauma abus bulli involv even without look around today even mani peopl seem happi surfac appear afflict mental parasit subconsci taught never realiz bullshit peopl alreadi convent attract get surgeri wear makeup look better peopl alreadi rich hoard money car jewelri alway tri get fuck drive constant dissatisfact seem key truli peac least one first major step realiz intellectu know truli realiz core taught happi obtain bullshit fact simpli continu believ lie default instead see farc might one biggest factor respons lot human suffer depress

But for those of you who feel like reading is a chore, or find yourself avoiding it for some reason even though you have access to interesting reading material, seriously consider that it might be in part because you're holding on to some preconceived notion about how fast you ""should"" be able to read (compared to your reading speed with your native language, or to the reading speed of Japanese natives).

That notion is either causing you to rush through sentences faster than your brain can comfortably process, or causing you to be partially distracted by background judgmental thoughts of how slow you're reading. This can often lead to brain fog, more parsing or comprehension errors, or just make for a stressful reading experience in general. And that tense, rushed feeling, even if its subtle, becomes negatively associated with reading Japanese as a whole which makes you not want to do it.

So as much as you can, try to release those expectations and judgments about your reading speed, and instead just let yourself feel good about every character, word, and sentence you understand. Treat yourself like a 2nd grader in Japanese. No one expects 2nd graders to breeze through pages of text at the rate of a college-level adult. They are allowed to go ゆっくり and take their time. Reading this language is relatively just as new to you as it is for Japanese 2nd graders, if not newer. So let yourself go as slow as feels comfortable to you, even if that's 10 minutes per page right now. Giving yourself that permission and encouragement, and losing the frustrating expectations might just result in you reading *more* and *more often.*

Besides, you will naturally become faster the more you practice reading; especially if you read with awareness of [meaningful chunks](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/9ng9ip/an_awesome_article_about_how_to_read_more/) rather than just one word at a time, or throw some [repeated reading practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/arefq5/a_fantastic_simple_way_to_increase_reading_speed/) into your routine. But even if you choose to use techniques like that, don't be mistaken - the key to consistently faster reading isn't forcing yourself to go faster than you can comfortably process in any given session. It's letting your brain get better and better at parsing and reading comprehension, so that it naturally starts to feel comfortable going faster; and that just takes regular, skillful practice.

By repeatedly sitting in meditation with intense emotions that initially seem threatening to us, such as fear and anger, I have over time become very familiar with the insight that they are literally nothing more than sensations in our bodies - but with stories associated with them mentally. 

I have seen repeatedly that when I can release the story (however compelling it may initially seem), compassionately accept the presence of the sensation, and breathe with it, it sooner or later begins to evaporate like a mist, until I’m left with a profound peace, clarity and understanding. 

This has brought tremendous joy and lightness to my life. But I can’t help but be disturbed when I consider *how many people do not know that this is even possible*. 

How many needless incidents of bullying, schoolground fights and pub brawls, public attacks and shootings, perhaps even genocides and war could have been prevented if people knew they didn’t have to be slaves to their mind’s stories - and that peace wasn’t a matter of obeying their emotionally charged thoughts, but of opening their heart’s capacity to simply feel without judgment.

There was a lot of purification happening throughout the sit.

I was sobbing most of it. Buried thoughts and emotions were arising, mostly related to my deeply ingrained habit of punishing myself because I believed I had to, in order to ever become loveable and good enough. There was a clear seeing of how, as the preteen who first developed this habit, I didn't know any better. How I was trying desperately to help myself be accepted and survive but because I was in ignorance, the best I could think of was essentially self-abuse. And how that habit has caused me so much needless pain in my life.

I cried and cried, and before long there was a metta impulse. Just this strong urge to offer metta to myself.

But it didn't come up as ""May I be well. May I be happy,"" the kind of phrases I usually use when I'm doing exclusive metta practice. It came up as;

""there there sweetheart. it's okay, it's okay.""

""you were doing the best you could. you didn't know better.""

""you are forgiven, you are forgiven.""

""cry as much as you need to. take your time.""

I recognized this as metta because the same focused intention and feeling was there as when I do traditional metta. But this time, when I spontaneously tapped into it, the words that naturally flowed out sounded like that instead. Just like... a really caring parent listening to me, making space for me to feel.

After a generous amount of that, which caused me to enter a pretty deep state of metta, I came back to more traditional phrases ""May I be well, may I be free,"" etc. The whole experience left me in a profound sense of freedom and being held in love.

But one big takeaway I had, was that perhaps we can be pretty flexible with metta, in the words we use. Perhaps there are ways of offering ourselves metta that feel more natural at certain times, and thus help us open our hearts easier? I see a lot of potential for this in my everyday life, as well as future sits.

When someone with relatively serious issues, perhaps depression, anxiety, chronic pain or addiction talks about their meditation practice, there's always someone who chimes in with ""Remember, meditation is not a cure.""

And I understand why people are motivated to say this. If you are a beginner, or even someone who's been at it for a months or longer but hasn't gone very deep, yes meditation can help you become more calm, focus a bit better, and start to shift your perspective a bit. But it likely won't cause some amazing, dramatic transformation in your mind and behavior.

However, that doesn't mean it *can't*.

On more specific, guidance-centered and ""intense"" meditation subreddits like r/TheMindIlluminated and r/streamentry , there are people from all walks of life, ex-addicts, disabled people or those living with chronic illness, and many, many people who used to suffer from anxiety and depression, who do not hesitate to say that meditation has completely transformed their lives, their minds, the way they see the world, their pain, their habits, everything.

And that isn't to say we should start telling addicts and depressed people to quit their recovery programs/meds now and just meditate. No no no. Like I said, beginners or people doing less targeted practices likely won't be capable of such radical changes. They should continue with whatever helps them for as long as they need to, along with their meditation to help them relax/de-stress. Also, some of the people I'm referring to still utilized some form of therapy at different stages of their practice (usually with psychologists well-versed in mindfulness and meditative therapies), which is great!

That being said, I do think it's important to start acknowledging that very effective meditation instructions and guidance (equipped with any necessary troubleshooting, and applied consistently over time) *CAN* lead to what can be considered a ""cure"" to many human woes. For example,

\- Developing the capability to experience and maintain blissful peace and clarity of mind as a default state, could put an end to someone's attachment to addictive drugs or compulsive eating

\- Cultivating a genuine sense of heartfelt love and appreciation for one's existence and connection to others, that can be reliably accessed over a lasting period of time, could effectively eliminate a person's need for depression medication

\- Having deep, penetrating insight into the nature of panic experiences, allowing them to appear as a non-threatening collection of empty mental formations & physical reactions conditioned by past experiences, which fade way much more quickly upon the maturation of said insight, could free someone from chronic anxiety, social or otherwise

From what I've seen, these kinds of changes can take around a year of consistent practice for 1 hour+ a day, while using fleshed out, advanced guides and teachings like The Mind Illuminated. But it is indeed happening to people. Perhaps its time for us to start opening up to the possibility of real healing and transformation via meditation.

Just some food for thought. Namaste, everyone.

3458,0.133,1.1342948584729207,2.675,2.0,0,1,0,0,1,02/16/2019,freebichbaby,"A fantastic & simple way to increase reading speed & fluency, without learning more words! For a long time I thought that getting faster at reading Japanese ｍostly just required me to learn more words. The more words I knew, the less I'd have to pause to think about things, the quicker I'd read.

Although that's certainly part of the equation, it turns out that there are other micro-skills involved in reading, aside from just learning all the words or grammar you don't know. Some of these micro-skills involve training your eyes to move across the text and your mind to decode it (convert it from lines to words to meaningful phrases) at a faster, more synchronized and steady pace. As well as simply training your mind to *expect* successful decoding with more confidence.

From a bunch of research and experimentation, I discovered that these skills can be greatly improved *not just by reading more in general*, but by a practice called **REPEATED READING**.

This actually turns out to be very popular practice in more progressive English-teaching classrooms. There are tons of [teaching articles](https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/49_3_4_cohen-1.pdf) and even [research studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813002541) vouching for how well it improves' students reading abilities. It sounds self-explanatory, but there are certain ways of going about it that maximize it's effectiveness. Here's how I do it:

**Materials:** interesting book, story, or article (not manga), some tool for sectioning off smaller amounts of text (like copy and paste if its on a computer, or a skinny sticky note if it's a physical book), a small notebook and pencil/pen, a stopwatch (I use my phone)

1. Pick a book or story that you're pretty sure is around your level, and mark off a section to read (that you haven't read yet!) that's 5\~10 sentences long or so (you can experiment with length, but this has been my sweet spot for steady improvement!)
2. Turn on a stopwatch and start reading. DO NOT RUSH. Read as gradually as you need to comprehend as much as you can given what you currently know. Do not worry about words you don't know. Also, [see this thread on chunking to aid comprehension.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/9ng9ip/an_awesome_article_about_how_to_read_more/)
3. Once you've reached the end of the text sample, press stop on the stopwatch and record your time in the notebook, next to ①.
4. Take a few breaths, with your focus off the text. Then read it again from the beginning, logging your times again for rounds ② and ③ (even up to ④ if you want!). Read without *forcing* speed, but definitely allow your pace to speed up if it feels comfortable and you're not losing comprehension.
5. Take a short break, then repeat the whole process with another sample of text of similar length.

* As for whether to read out loud or in your head, I practice both ways, with a ratio of about 3:1, out loud:in my head. I make a note of which way I'm practicing next to each set of times. Also, ""out loud"" is usually more like a quiet, near- whisper for me, not full volume. I preserve energy that way, while still practicing the mouth movements and 発音.
* Another option is to have sessions every once in a while where you record yourself for a set or two. Then you can listen to your increase in improvement, making for even more confidence and reinforcement.

**The results of doing this, which you'd probably expect:**

\- Your speed will naturally increase with each repetition of the same sample text

\- Comprehension will feel smoother with each repetition

**Now for the perhaps unexpected, but still very real results!**

\- The speed increases you achieve between reps of each given sample will, little by little, *transfer to your overall reading speed!* And that overall increase in reading speed will occur significantly more rapidly than it would have *if you were just reading different texts once each*, as is typically recommended.

\- Your brain will naturally become more oriented towards *extracting meaning* from Japanese texts, versus ""figuring out"" texts, making for more fluid, native-like reading.

\- Confidence in your reading ability will improve. You'll approach texts with less apprehension, even if there are words you don't know.

\- Unknown words will become easier to skip over without interrupting flow of comprehension by ruminating on them like learners tend to.

I've seen all these results (both the ""expected"" and ""unexpected"") start happening within just a day of doing 3, 20 minute repeated reading sessions. Continuing for three weeks (10 to 30 minutes a day) has made the effects undeniable. I've even noticed I read Japanese subtitles much faster now while watching shows.

I could go on and on about what I think is happening in the brain to have this effect. One mechanism I'm convinced of is that, when our brains truly expect that it will be able to successfully extract meaning from a text (which it naturally will if we're reading the same chunk of text a 2nd, 3rd, and even 4th time in a row) it relaxes our ""language learner"" habits of fragmented, hyper-conscious analyzation, and settles into a more native-like ""flow"", where that expectation of meaning is just gliding it through the decoding process. That flow of more automatic, subconscious processing becomes more habitual with practice.

Anyway, I hope those of you who are interested in improving your reading will try this out and see some great results for yourselves :)",long time thought get faster read japanes ostli requir learn word word knew less paus think thing quicker read although certainli part equat turn micro skill involv read asid learn all word grammar know micro skill involv train eye move across text mind decod convert line word meaning phrase faster synchron steadi pace well simpli train mind expect success decod confid bunch research experiment discov skill greatli improv read gener practic call repeat read actual turn popular practic progress english teach classroom ton teach articl americanenglish state gov file ae resourc file cohen pdf even research studi sciencedirect scienc articl pii vouch well improv student read abil sound self explanatori certain way go maxim effect materi interest book stori articl manga tool section smaller amount text copi past comput skinni sticki note physic book small notebook pencil pen stopwatch use phone pick book stori pretti sure around level mark section read read yet sentenc long experi length sweet spot steadi improv turn stopwatch start read rush read gradual need comprehend much given current know worri word know also see thread chunk aid comprehens learnjapanes comment ng ip awesom articl read reach end text sampl press stop stopwatch record time notebook next take breath focu text read begin log time round even want read without forc speed definit allow pace speed feel comfort lose comprehens take short break repeat whole process anoth sampl text similar length whether read loud head practic way ratio loud head make note way practic next set time also loud usual quiet near whisper full volum preserv energi way still practic mouth movement anoth option session everi record set two listen increas improv make even confid reinforc result probabl expect speed natur increas repetit sampl text comprehens feel smoother repetit perhap unexpect still real result speed increas achiev rep given sampl littl littl transfer overal read speed overal increas read speed occur significantli rapidli would read differ text typic recommend brain natur becom orient toward extract mean japanes text versu figur text make fluid nativ read confid read abil improv approach text less apprehens even word know unknown word becom easier skip without interrupt flow comprehens rumin learner tend seen all result expect unexpect start happen within day minut repeat read session continu three week minut day made effect undeni even notic read japanes subtitl much faster watch show could go think happen brain effect one mechan convinc brain truli expect abl success extract mean text natur read chunk text nd rd even th time row relax languag learner habit fragment hyper consciou analyz settl nativ flow expect mean glide decod process flow automat subconsci process becom habitu practic anyway hope interest improv read tri see great result

I  briefly tried memorizing the ones she presented but I soon realized it would be more helpful to just recognize these patterns in words as I encountered them in my own study/reading. As I work more intensively with vocabulary these days I'm seeing more and more how helpful it is to have this concept as a part of my study!

Basically the idea is that the kanji in many 熟語 (compound words) share the same pronunciation with kanji that have a similar visual component. Recognizing this pattern between words we learn can be very encouraging to our brains to remember those readings. It's not a perfectly consistent rule or anything, but when you find one and make a conscious note of it (in my vocab notebook I like to use a colored pen to underline the kanji that are ""sound sisters"" with another kanji I know), it can be a fun and quite effective way to help remember!

Some ""sound sisters"" I've found recently:

幸福　こう・ふく

睾丸　こう・がん

増幅　ぞう・ふく

check out the two ふく's and こう's and look at the similar component between those kanji!

迫害　はく・がい

告白　こく・はく

check out the similar component in the two はく's.

依然　い・ぜん

I hesitated before due to the lack of a reliable, offline dictionary I could use on my mobile phone, but [I finally found one in the Japanese app store I really like](https://imgur.com/a/IKcgYfe)!

I want to talk about things I've noticed using it so far, which I think highlight the merits of a J-J dictionary. Before switching, I did a little research on this subreddit and found, surprisingly, that a lot of people were saying things like ""it doesn't really make a difference whether you use J-J or not"" and ""J-E does pretty much the same thing"". I strongly disagree, given what I've been experiencing so far!

I will say that of course beginners should stick with J-E. There's no reason to overly tax yourself by forcing the use of a dictionary in a language you barely understand yet. But for people around intermediate and certainly higher, I now see no reason not to use J-J as your main source of definitions. Here are things I\`ve noticed:

**1. A more intuitive understanding of the words I learn**, with no need for an intermediary English translation to ""bridge the gap"". What I mean by this is, when I look up a word and read the Japanese explanation for it, I feel like I ""get"" the meaning, without needing some English word to confirm that. The meaning itself, the thing, feeling, action or concept being pointed to, is understood and directly brought to mind in an ""ah ha!"" moment. Rather than relying on the middleman of ""what we'd call this in English"". It feels more intuitive.

**2. I'm spending more time in the mindstate of Japanese, in the ""world"" of Japanese.** I'm no longer switching back and forth between English, and in a way this seems to be easier on my brain too. There's a sort of flow that's maintained, a continuity. I never leave the Japanese ""realm"", there's a feeling of more integration, and the language feels more ""real"".

**3. I'm getting a better understanding of synonyms, and seeing how many words are related!** In a definition there will usually contain a word I already know that means close to the same thing as the word I'm looking up. This is super helpful in reinforcing both the word I'm looking up, and the word I already knew that it's referring to. Its helping build mental collections of words I can be sure mean similar things. These collections are very useful.

**4. I feel like I'm training my ability to explain words and concepts in Japanese.** Both to myself and other people. When I'm talking to a Japanese person and can't think of a certain word or the name of a thing I saw, it feels like it's becoming more natural to describe it well. The sentence structure of an explanation, the use of words like ようす and 状態 to point to things, etc. I feel like I'm gaining proficiency in being able to do that.

It might seem like just a new-age hippy trend to some people but there is actually tons of compelling evidence for its effectiveness, and in all honesty it has helped the heck out of my Japanese study. 

Studying after a session of concentration meditation feels like I turned my INT and DEX up 100 points or something (excuse the lame RPG reference but its just what came out), I'm cruising over kanji and other words as I read in a way that feels more effortless and intuitive rather than strained. There's not this nagging feeling in the background of ""you're not doing good enough"" that often distracted me in the past from being fully present and focused on my study. 

My mind is also better at splitting up individual tasks and working in an organized manner. I can even switch attention between tasks (for example, writing sentences or kanji, then reading, then listening practice, then doing reviews) with greater ease and much less of that scatterbrain feeling. 

It's true that usually our minds are clouded with soooo much crap and we don't even know it because we're used to just dwelling in that crap-bubble. Meditation clears that shit out (not immediately all at once, it is a skill that takes practice but even small increases in clarity can make a big difference) so your brain can work like a shiny brain with the tubes cleaned out. 

Highly recommend for people who aren't already doing it. Especially for those who struggle with maintaining concentration, procrastinating, or an overly judgmental and strained orientation to  any aspect of their Japanese study.

I've been obsessively researching lately about how to up my reading skill. I found an article in Japanese thats targeted towards Japanese people learning English, but applies wonderfully to Japanese-learners as well! It even has an example using Japanese, which I excerpted below.

The tips discussed are probably things a lot of advanced learners here already know, but for someone like me who's struggled with defaulting to ""robot-mode"", and getting overwhelmed with reading in one endless stream, it's a great reminder to change that habit and nail down the habit of chunking and pausing as I read Japanese.

I've been experimenting with smaller chunks of 2 to 3 words first, which will likely get a bit bigger as I practice. For example w/the example sentence in the article, I would've had one more pause right after 今日は. But I'm already noticing the difference in smoothness of progression and comprehension! 

Enjoy! I hope it's helpful for some of you guys.

The photos for each story are corny stock images but don't let that deter you! The stories cover topics from being bullied, to crazy things that happened during their jobs, being a single mother, friendship experiences, having money issues, getting married and even being cheated on. There are about 40 categories in all, and each has around 6 to 20 stories.

The stories are so addictive to read, quite short in length (maybe 70\~100 sentences each?) and there are so many of them. Since they're 体験談 from random everyday people, they're written with very useful, everyday language. Farming sentences or vocab from it if you're into that wouldn't be a bad idea at all.

I've found some of these stories to be quite relateable. Here's an excerpt from a story by a woman who has been called ugly by random people multiple times in her life and how it's affected her. This is about 1/3 of the story (feel free to skip it, only read some, or just check out the site for yourself for a story you're interested in!):

高校を卒業した私は、地元を離れ、同じ高校からは誰も進学しなかった大学へ入学しました。

とくに「高校時代の人間関係をリセットしたい」というような意図はありません。

地元からは距離があることもあって、私以外は誰も、わざわざその大学を選ぼうとは思わなかったようです。

そんなわけで私は、大学入学と同時に、人間関係を一からつくりあげなければならなくなりました。

私が専攻していたのは心理学で、幸い同じ専修コースを選択していたのは20人ほど。

「高校の1クラスよりも少ない人数なら、なんとか溶け込めるかもしれない」と思ったのです。

しかし、容姿は残念でコミュ力も低く、学業もパッとしないため、同級生からの印象がかなり薄かった私。

なかなか、仲のいい友だちはできませんでした。

「どうしたらいいんだろうな」と悩みつつ、ひとりで学食にきたとき、ある会話を聞いてしまったんです。

それは、同じ心理学コースの男の子Aくんと、Bくんの会話でした。

私が座った席は、ちょうど彼らのななめ後ろで、2人は私がそこにいることには気がついていなかったようです。

話題は、どうやら心理学コースの親睦会のこと。

2人が幹事になって開催しようと、メンバーをリストアップしているところのようでした。

**すると、Aくんが「あの人はどうする？」と言い出したんです。**

「あの人って誰よ」とBくん。

「あのいつもひとつ結びの……、髪の毛くるくるしてる……」、どうやら名前が出てこない様子のAくん。

私は「髪の毛くるくる」で、「間違いなく私のことだな」と考えていました。

「あー、えーっとなんだっけ、名前忘れたな」と、うなるBくん。

そんな会話に「私、私！」と出ていくことができれば良かったのでしょうが、もちろん私にそんな積極性はありません。

**どうなることかと見守っていると、Aくんが「あのブスな人だよ」とぽつりとつぶやいたんです。**

その直後Bくんに「おまえ、その言い方はないだろ」と怒られていたものの、その後2人の会話に出てきたのは、もちろん私の名前。

「男性陣の共通認識としても、私はブスなんだなあ」と思うと、なんだか切ない気持ちに。

So I recently [posted a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/9hwtqz/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_listening_practice/) discussing how I was using English subs during the second listen of an anime episode (first listen was sub-free), to help me transcribe the Japanese I was not able to pick up the first time. For me, that was 28 lines out of about 350. Meaning, the remaining \~320 lines I could understand the first time, no subtitles, all Japanese audio.

I knew opinions would be controversial since many learners seem to think that using English at all for any part of Japanese practice is horrible and cancels any benefit you might be gaining.

Yet after submitting the thread, I had a Japanese native (a friend I made on Tandem) go through each part of the anime with me that I transcribed, and check each of those 28. He said all of my transcripts were perfect except one. I'd heard「中には」instead of「の子には」for line 19.

**Now here lies the question of debate.** If I was able to correctly reproduce the Japanese being spoken (NOT my best attempt at a Japanese translation from only referencing the English subs, but *the exact words the characters were actually saying*) for 27 of those 28 lines, how was I *not* still exercising my Japanese listening skill (as well as vocab and grammar recognition skills)?

I want to get to the bottom of this criticism of ""Eng subs can never help you improve your Japanese and they can only ever hurt your progress"" -- because it runs really counter to my experience doing this exercise, especially having a Japanese person confirm that my 聞き取り was near flawless. Even when I told him I looked at the English subs the second time to create those transcripts, he told me that there are many ways I could've translated those English subs into Japanese, but I was able to pick the words and grammar, 漢字 included, that actually matched the characters spoken words, so it still shows a lot of skill.

So really, what is the basis for such a vehement avoidance of the L1 in cases like this? Especially when the alternative is just straight up looking at the J-subs, or asking a J-person what was being said. That wouldn't require any skill or effort at all in decoding the spoken language.

1. Watch anime episode straight through, subtitles completely blacked out (so no english or japanese subs, pure listening and watching). Following the story and just enjoying it without any straining.
2. After finishing the ep, rewatch with the English subs uncovered and transcribe (type what I hear) in a wordpad file the Japanese for **any sentences I didn't catch the first watch** \-- as long as I'm confident about the vocab and grammar being used (or if I am really curious about one unknown word and know everything else in the sentence, then I can look it up and make a note of its reading in my transcript).
3. Read through the sentence list aloud to further reinforce them.

Now I know many learners believe using any English at all is horrible and won't help you progress at all and if you ever use subs they should be the Japanese ones -- which I have indeed used many times, BUT. I feel like that could be incorrect in this case. It seems like using an English translation (which I know is often not exact, & more rarely, not even close) as a ""hint"" to help you produce the Japanese you weren't able to 聞き取る the first time, actually trains skills that simply looking at the Japanese subs to give you the answer, wouldn't train. Like reproducing pre-existing grammar and vocabulary knowledge and putting it together to match what the characters are saying. The added effort required to figure it out (including repeated listens) could do more to help solidify one's リスニング力 than just referencing the J-subs right away.

Here's an example, and feel free to skip all of this or only read a few sentences. I watched the second episode of こみっくがーるず for this activity (a recent moe girl anime, don't shoot!). Out of maybe 350 lines of text, the ones I didn't catch at first (but ended up knowing the vocabulary and grammar for upon the 2nd watch) were the following 28. Parts that I  still couldn't understand what they were saying in Japanese, I skipped transcribing completely (I counted 9 such instances, so less than 0.3%. Not bad!):

It's possible that some fraction of these I would've been able to catch without using the english subs the second time, simply from repeating the audio with no hints. But it seems as though not being used to hearing certain words or phrases used in speech, or used to the way the characters say certain things, may have made it more difficult, which imo isn't necessarily beneficial for learning. I think having the English there for the second round made that connection of ""ohhh, so THAT'S what they were saying?"" happen a lot faster than it would've otherwise. But without simply giving me the answer like looking at the J-subs would, so I still had to use my ear. This is just my theorizing!
